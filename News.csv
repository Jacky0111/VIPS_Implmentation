REUTERS/Issei Kato (Reuters) -     The president of Poland's swimming federation (PZP) has apologised after six athletes were sent home from the Tokyo Games due to an administrative error. Poland had sent 23 swimmers to Japan but the PZP was forced to cut the squad down to 17 based on world governing body FINA's qualifying rules. PZP President Pawel Slominski apologised and said he fully understood the anger of the swimmers who returned home over the weekend. ""I express great regret, sadness and bitterness about the situation related to the qualification of our swimmers for the Olympic Games in Tokyo,"" Slominski said in a statement http://www.polswim.pl/sites/default/files/oswiadczenie_prezesa_pzp.pdf. ""Such a situation should not take place, and the reaction of the swimmers, their emotions, the attack on the Polish Swimming Federation is understandable to me and justified."" He said the error was due to the ""desire to allow as many players and coaches as possible to take part in the Games"". Media reports identified the six swimmers as Alicja Tchorz, Bartosz Piszczorowicz, Aleksandra Polanska, Mateusz Chowaniec, Dominika Kossakowska and Jan Holub. Tchorz, who competed at the 2012 and 2016 Games, expressed her anger on social media. ""Imagine dedicating five years of your life and striving for another start at the most important sporting event ... giving up your private life and work, sacrificing your family ... your dedication results in a total flop,"" she said on Facebook. Chowaniec added on Instagram: ""I'm deeply shocked by what happened... this is an absurd situation for me that should never have happened. In fact, I hope to wake up from this nightmare eventually."" Swimming news website SwimSwam reported several Polish swimmers had signed an open letter to the PZP seeking the resignation of the organisation's entire board.

"PETALING JAYA: The challenge has been laid for the Malaysian Olympians – Get Malaysia’s first gold in Japan! Youth and Sports Minister Datuk Seri Reezal Merican Naina Merican has announced that the target for Tokyo is three medals and one of them is gold. The sports earmarked to get medals are cycling, badminton and diving. Reezal said the gold could be a joy for the nation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic and believes Malaysia has longed for someone to win the revered gold in the Olympics. “When I spoke to the athletes, they showed great spirit, and many have shown great optimism to do something special in Tokyo. Even our chef de mission and badminton legend Datuk Lee Chong Wei wants someone to break his record. He would be satisfied if that happens,”said Reezal from the Youth and Sports Ministry Tower in Putrajaya via a virtual press conference yesterday. “I know some nations, especially Singapore, have not set a target and told their athletes just to do their best, but in Malaysia, these athletes have put their own KPI (key performance indicator). We have taken the middle ground. “We don’t want to be too optimistic and too pessimistic at the same time, but we hope someone can bring back a gold from Tokyo.” Malaysia have participated in the Olympics since Melbourne in 1956 but the gold medal remained elusive, although badminton, cycling and diving have contributed medals. For the games in Tokyo, many are pinning their hopes on track cyclist Datuk Azizulhasni Awang to bring home the gold, but in a recent interview, he believes others could do that too. The 33-year-old Azizul, who will be going for his fourth straight Olympics, feels diver Pandelela Rinong, shuttler Lee Zee Jia and even teammate Shah Firdaus Sahrom can also end the drought. In the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Malaysia won four silvers and a bronze. Chong Wei brought home the men’s badminton singles silver, Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying won silver in the mixed doubles, Goh V Shem-Tan Wee Kiong were runners-up in the men’s doubles and Pandalela Rinong-Cheong Jun Hoong won the women’s synchronised 10m platform silver. When asked if other sports can spring a surprise, Reezal hopes that something of that sort could happen. “No one expected V Shen-Wee Kiong and Peng Soon-Liu Ying to qualify for the final in Brazil, but they did. So if they can do it, I believe others can too. “All these 30 athletes in Tokyo will want to achieve some milestone. Qualifying for the games is already a considerable achievement, but they for sure would like to break their personal best or even the national record. “Sometimes data crunching does not guarantee results. The athletes themselves are the determinant factor. They have to endure lots of challenges, especially during this pandemic. Their willpower has been good, and I believe it would lead to something good.” As for the Paralympics, the target is to emulate the success in Rio, where they won three gold medals. In Rio, the athletes who won gold were Mohd Ridzuan Mohd Puzi (men’s 100m T36/F36), Mohd Ziyad Zolkefli (men’s shot putt T20/F20) and Abdul Latif Romly (men’s long jump T20/F20). Siti Nor Radiah Ismail was the other medalist when she won bronze in the women’s long jump T20/F20. Ridzuan, Ziyad and Latif will look to defend their titles in Tokyo, and there is hope that Malaysia could win gold in badminton through world number two Cheah Liek Hou in the men’s singles SU5 and powerlifting through world record holder Bonnie Bunyau in the men’s 72kg category. Bonnie won the Para Powerlifting World Cup last month with a world record of 230kg, breaking Iranian Rostami Roohallah’s record of 229kg set in 2019. World champion S. Suresh is also a candidate to get gold in the men’s individual recurve archery event. MUCH has been said about the availability of jobs during these challenging times.

"It’s game on: Chan Peng Soon (back) and Goh Liu Ying open their Group D campaign against Hong Kong’s Tang Chun Man-Tse Ying Suet. — AFP PETALING JAYA: Mixed doubles ace Chan Peng Soon is no illusionist. But he can imagine and hear millions of Malaysian fans cheering loudly when the Olympics badminton competition gets under way on Saturday at the 10,000 capacity but empty Musashino Forest Sports Plaza. The 33-year-old admits that it will be strange to be playing his first Olympics without fans but nothing is going to stop him from playing his heart out for all the Malaysians who will be watching him and partner Goh Liu Ying in action live from their TV and online. Amid the surge in Covid-19 cases in Japan, the organisers announced a ban on fans attending the Olympics events in the Tokyo. Peng Soon and Liu Ying open their Group D campaign against Hong Kong’s Tang Chun Man-Tse Ying Suet at the US$300mil (RM1.26bil) stadium, a venue where the duo played at the 2018 and 2019 Japan Open. “We played there twice in 2018 and 2019, so it will definitely feel strange for not having any spectators. But there’s nothing we can do about it,” said Peng Soon after testing the venue together with the entire Malaysian team yesterday. “An empty stadium is still perfectly fine for me because I know for a fact that we have millions of Malaysian fans supporting us from home, so I could still imagine the cheers we’re getting despite the quiet atmosphere. “With Malaysia still under lockdown, I think we will have even more supporters this time because most people will be staying at home most of the time and watching the action on their screens. “For that, we must try to perform our very best to justify their support and not let them down.” World No. 7 Peng Soon-Liu Ying will surely hope that Tokyo, and particularly Musashino Forest Sports Plaza, continue to be a lucky charm for them as they try to go one better than their silver medal feat in Rio five years ago. The Japanese capital proved to be their favourite hunting ground after winning the Japan Open back in 2012 and reaching the semi-finals in their last three appearances in 2016, 2018 and 2019. “Hopefully it will continue that way, but I don’t think our last few outings in Tokyo will count for anything,” stressed Peng Soon. “It’s good performances that produce good results, so we have to give our best in every single match.” MUCH has been said about the availability of jobs during these challenging times.

"The beds to be used by the athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, made partially from recyclable cardboard, are displayed during a press preview in Tokyo, Japan January 9, 2020, in this photo taken by Kyodo. Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS  (Reuters) -     Irish gymnast Rhys McClenaghan has debunked the idea that the cardboard-framed beds for athletes in the Tokyo Olympic Village were not strong enough to withstand vigorous activity and were therefore ""anti-sex"" - by recording himself leaping up and down on the one in his room. Organisers said athletes competing in the Games would sleep on bed frames made from recyclable cardboard and mattresses made of polyethylene materials that would be reused to make plastic products after the Games. Manufacturer Airweave said the beds could support around 200 kilograms but some media reports claimed they were made out of cardboard to collapse under the weight of more than one person to promote social distancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. American distance runner Paul Chelimo wrote on Twitter on Saturday that the decision to have cardboard beds was ""aimed at avoiding intimacy among athletes."" ""The beds are meant to be 'anti-sex' ... They're made out of cardboard, yes, and apparently they're meant to break at any sudden movements... It's fake! Fake news,"" he said while jumping on his bed in a video clip. The official Olympics Twitter account thanked McClenaghan in a tweet on Monday for clearing up the matter and added: ""The sustainable cardboard beds are sturdy."" Organisers plan to give away about 150,000 condoms at the Games, but are telling athletes to take them home rather than use them in the village where social distancing rules and coronavirus measures are top priority. Olympics officials on Sunday reported the first COVID-19 case among competitors in the village where most of the 11,000 athletes are expected stay during the July 23-Aug. 8 Games.

"FILE PHOTO: A silhouette of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games Athletes' Village is seen in Tokyo, Japan, July 19, 2021. REUTERS/Naoki Ogura TOKYO (Reuters) -The isolation bubble system that Olympic organisers have set up at the Tokyo Games village to control COVID-19 is already broken, and there is a risk that infections could spread more widely from inside it, a prominent public health expert said on Tuesday. Games officials on Sunday reported the first coronavirus case among competitors in the village in Tokyo where 11,000 athletes are expected to stay. There have been 67 cases detected among those accredited for the Games since July 1, organisers said on Tuesday. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said last week that testing and quarantine protocols would leave ""zero"" risk of Games participants infecting residents in Japan. Kenji Shibuya, the former director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London, said such declarations only served to confuse and anger people as actual conditions on the ground were ""totally opposite"".  ""It's obvious that the bubble system is kind of broken,"" said Shibuya, who in April co-authored a British Medical Journal commentary that said the Olympics must be ""reconsidered"" due to Japan's inability to contain coronavirus cases. ""My biggest concern is, of course, there will be a cluster of infections in the village or some of the accommodation and interaction with local people.""  Insufficient testing at the bubble's border and the impossibility of controlling people's movements mean that the Games could exacerbate the spread of the infectious Delta variant of the virus, he said. Continual reports of cases that went undetected at the airport, along videos showing interaction between athletes, staff and journalists, add to concerns that airborne transmission will occur within the village and venues, he added.  New COVID-19 cases in Tokyo reached 1,410 on Saturday, a near six month high, while the Games are due to start in just three days. Public health experts have warned that seasonal factors, increased mobility, and the spread of the Delta variant could lead to a surge past 2,000 cases per day in Tokyo by next month, levels that could drive the city's medical system to breaking point. Just 33% of people in Japan have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, among the lowest rate among wealthy countries, according to a Reuters tracker. The vaccination push  has gained steam since last month, but recently ebbed due to supply and logistical snags. By contrast, Soma City in the northern prefecture of Fukushima, where Shibuya headed its vaccination efforts, recently completed the bulk of its inoculations, far ahead of most of Japan.

"Looking dangerous: Japan’s Yuta Watanabe (back) reclaimed the All-England mixed doubles crown with Arisa Higashino which they last won in 2018. — AFP PETALING JAYA: For an elite national shuttler, winning an Olympic gold medal itself is already no ordinary feat. So, what are the odds against one player bagging two golds in a single edition? Of course, only doubles specialists would be able to do so as they can qualify in two events at the Olympics. Most importantly, the shuttler must be able to sustain top form throughout the Games. To date, only Zhao Yunlei of China had accomplished the double triumph when she won the women’s doubles with Tian Qing and mixed doubles with Zhang Nan to inspire her country’s clean sweep of all five golds at stake in London 2012 edition. In Rio five years ago, Zhang Nan nearly created his own history by becoming the first men’s shuttler to realise the outstanding achievement – but he fell short. He managed to win gold with Fu Haifeng in the men’s doubles but failed to defend the mixed doubles title with Yunlei and could only managed a bronze. In Tokyo this time, there are three men players who will be on double duty and stand a chance of pulling off the splendid feat – Yuta Watanabe of Japan, South Korea’s Seo Seung-jae and Germany’s Mark Lamsfuss. Of the trio, Watanabe appears to be the one with the brightest prospect. Although he did not openly declare it, it is obvious the 24-year-old will head into the home Olympics aiming big with Hiroyuki Endo and Arisa Higashino whom he formed the world No. 4 partnership in men’s doubles and No. 5 in mixed doubles respectively. Watanabe has every reason to be upbeat after becoming the first double titlists at the All-England Open in nearly two decades. Watanabe and Endo defended their 2020 title and then with Arisa, reclaimed the mixed doubles crown they last won in 2018. The feat saw Watanabe followed in the footsteps of South Korea’s Kim Dong-moon who achieved the feat in 2000 and 2002. Should Watanabe make it at the Olympics, then Malaysian coaches Jeremy Gan and Tan Kim Her, who are currently in charge of the Japan’s mixed doubles and men’s doubles squads, would surely have a hand in it. “Yuta did not mention anything to me (about his ambition) but he will always do his best to bring glory to his country,” said Jeremy.

"FILE PHOTO: Japan's Kohei Uchimura reacts after performing on the horizontal bar at Friendship and Solidarity Competition, the first international event at a Tokyo Olympic venue since the Games were postponed in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in Tokyo, Japan November 8, 2020. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon (Reuters) -     Japanese athletes to watch at their home Olympics. Uchimura qualified for his fourth and final Games in a tiebreaker and is set to end his illustrious Olympic career in his native Japan. Sometimes called ""King Kohei"", Uchimura became the first male gymnast in 44 years to win back-to-back Olympic all-around titles at the 2016 Games, leading Japan to gold in the team event. After surviving leukaemia, just being on Japan's Olympic team at a home Games may already be a victory for Rikako Ikee. The swimming star will be a firm favourite in the pool this summer.  She marked her 21st birthday in July as she and her teammates broke the national record for the women's 200-metre relay.  After winning six gold medals at the 2018 Asian Games and four titles at Japan's national championship this April, Ikee should roar through the 400-metres freestyle relay and 4x100 medley relay at the Tokyo Games. Four-time Grand Slam singles champion Naomi Osaka is widely considered a favourite for gold as she makes her Olympic debut at her home Games and on her favourite hard court surface. Osaka, who was named 2021 Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year, has been praised for using her platform to raise awareness of issues such as police violence, racial injustice and mental health. All eyes will be on the men's singles world number one, who has overcome personal and professional problems on the way to the Tokyo Olympics, including contracting COVID-19. Months before the Rio Games in 2016, Momota was embroiled in an illegal gambling scandal that led to his suspension by the Nippon Badminton Association. He was also removed from the world rankings. Momota got back on the court in 2017 at the rank of 282th clawed his way back with a 39-match unbeaten streak. Momota's Olympic dreams were again threatened in early 2020 when he was involved in a fatal car accident. But the pandemic gave him time to recover and he made his comeback at the All-England Open in March, raising Japanese hopes that he can challenge for Olympic gold. The top-ranked Japanese golfer, Matsuyama was already widely considered a favourite for the men's golf competition in Tokyo even before his Masters triumph in April made him the first Japanese golfer to win a men's major championship. Matsuyama will be in familiar surroundings when he makes his Olympics debut as the Kasumigaseki Country Club that is hosting the golfing competition. It was the site of one of his previous big wins, the 2010 Asian Amateur Championship. The Japan men's 4x100-metre relay team surprised the world when it captured the silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics. They defeated United States and Canada.  Rather than speed, their smooth baton-passing has been touted as a recipe for their silver win. Sprinter Ryota Yamagata who was part of the relay team at Rio, will run again in the relay this summer at his third Olympics. Yamagata is also the captain of Japan's team at the Tokyo Games.

The AITA said it had nominated Bopanna and Divij Sharan for the men's doubles but the pair were unable to get direct entry to the Games as their combined ranking was not high enough. It then withdrew Sharan's nomination and said it was putting forward Bopanna and Nagal, who has already qualified for the singles competition in Tokyo. However, Bopanna said on Monday the International Tennis Federation (ITF) had never accepted his entry with Nagal as there were no changes allowed to nominations after the June 22 deadline except for cases of injury or illness. ""AITA misled the players, government, media and everyone else by stating we still have a chance,"" the former doubles world No. 3 three tweeted. India's Sania Mirza, who will compete in women's doubles with Ankita Raina, said the situation was ""absolutely ridiculous and shameful"". ""By this it also means we have sacrificed a very good shot at a medal in the mixed doubles if you and I would have played as planned. We were both told that you and Sumit's names have been given,"" Mirza tweeted. The AITA said comments by Bopanna and Mirza were ""inappropriate"" and that the players did not know the rules. ""We at AITA tried to help our players with all combinations but they failed to make the cut based on rankings,"" the AITA said in a statement https://aitatennis.com/aita-condemns-misleading-and-inappropriate-tweets-by-rohan-bopanna-and-sania-mirza. ""Is Bopanna suggesting that we should have entered his name with Nagal one month ago, when Nagal's ranking was in the 140s and Sharan was at 78?"" An ITF spokesperson told Reuters that if there were any further withdrawals from the event replacements would come from athletes already on site.

"FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Women's International Friendly - France v USA - Stade Oceane, Le Havre, France - April 13, 2021 Becky Sauerbrunn of the U.S. during the warm up before the match REUTERS/Benoit Tessier TOKYO (Reuters) -     The U.S. women's soccer team are looking for payback when they kick off their Olympic campaign with what promises to be a tough challenge against Sweden on Wednesday, with memories still fresh of their quarter-final defeat in the Rio Games five years ago. The United States are not used to losing at that event in the Olympics, with gold medals in four of the six contests since a women's tournament was added in the 1996 Atlanta Games.  They start the competition as world champions, with plenty of matches in the run-up to Tokyo, and much to make amends for following the 2016 loss on penalties that marked the U.S. team's earliest departure from a major tournament.  ""It was one of the worst results that the senior national team has had in a major tournament, and from playing in that game I know how disappointed we all were. And for me it has lit a fire,"" said captain Becky Sauerbrunn. ""It was against Sweden and so it seems kind of rich that we get to play them for this Olympics."" The two sides drew 1-1 in a friendly in April, the only blot on the U.S. team's record this year of 11 wins from 12 matches, with only one goal conceded. They play in Group G, with New Zealand and Australia.  Sauerbrunn said the busy match schedule and the U.S. team's lengthy spell acclimatising in camp in Japan has helped preparations.  ""It has allowed us to work on tactics and really dig down into those details that are so important,"" she said. ""It does give us an advantage, but ...you never know what's going to happen."" Sweden have played only six games this year but are undefeated, and are ready to put up a strong fight against the Americans. ""We know we have to be very prepared. We have to step up to a level that is very high,"" said captain Caroline Seger.  ""It's going to be very intense. And I know also that the U.S. brings the best when they need to be the best so it's going to be a very tough game.""

"FILE PHOTO: Members of South Africa's Olympic soccer team work out ahead of Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Chiba, east of Tokyo, Japan July 19, 2021, in this photo taken by Kyodo. Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS    TOKYO (Reuters) -The first major test of how an Olympics can be held in the midst of a pandemic may well come this week in the men's soccer tournament when Japan face a South Africa side that could struggle to field 11 players due to the novel coronavirus. South Africa's squad was severely depleted by COVID-19 infections and withdrawals before they left for the Games and was then hit with the news that two players and a video analyst had tested positive on arrival in Tokyo. Organisers said late on Monday that 21 members of the delegation were close contacts, leaving South Africa walking a tightrope ahead of Thursday's match against the hosts. The number was later reduced to 18. The Olympic playbook on coronavirus prevention measures mandates that to compete a close contact must return daily negative PCR tests, including one within six hours of competition. They must also undergo a health check by an expert and receive permission from their international sporting federation.  FIFA regulations stipulate a team must have 13 available players for a match to go ahead and South Africa coach David Notoane said the daily testing means he has no idea who will be able to take the field to face the Japanese. ""You are not even sure who will be eligible for your (starting) 11 because of the situation we are in, testing every day,"" he told reporters about the team, who returned to training on Monday after a week off the pitch. ""Their (Japan's) physical readiness compared to us will be a key issue. It will make a huge difference. We basically lost seven days and that is hard to recover from."" Michiko Dohi, COVID-19 chief liaison officer with the Japan Olympic Committee, said that with the proper, strict steps being taken, the match could be held safely. There have been 58 positive cases of Olympics-linked athletes, staff or officials recorded in Japan this month. On Monday, a Czech beach volleyball player tested positive at the Olympic Village while an alternate for the U.S. women's gymnastics team tested positive at the site of their pre-Games training camp just outside Tokyo. Dohi said most of the positive cases had been contracted before the delegations entered Japan.

"(Reuters) -     British 800 metres runner Daniel Rowden said news that six of his team mates had to self-isolate following contact with an individual who tested positive for COVID-19 had left him feeling anxious ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.  The British Olympic Association said on Sunday the athletes and two staff members had been identified as close contacts to a positive case on their flight to Japan. The group are currently in their rooms at the team's preparation camp in Yokohama but British media have reported they hoped to train later on Tuesday after returning negative tests. ""To be locked in a room and not be able to train takes away from your confidence, takes away from your preparation,"" Rowden was quoted as saying by The Guardian. ""And then also there's a bit of fear that the same thing could happen to us. Those athletes were on the flight the day before us, so there's a little bit of trepidation that the same thing could happen to people on our flight as well."" Sprinter Richard Kilty said it would be ""heartbreaking"" for an athlete to miss out on training or competition with the Games set to begin on Friday. ""There is always the worry that you could randomly be pinged for whatever reason, or came into contact with someone, and you don't get a chance to train or compete,"" Kilty said. ""If someone was to come and miss out on their individual event this close to the Games, it would be heartbreaking for anybody. I wouldn't wish it on anyone.""

"FILE PHOTO: Rugby Union - New Zealand Press Conference - The Lensbury, London, Britain - November 6, 2018   New Zealand's Ian Foster during a press conference   Action Images via Reuters/Peter Cziborra (Reuters) -     New Zealand have been training to play with 14 men ahead of tests against Australia to prepare for the loss of red-carded players, All Blacks coach Ian Foster said. The All Blacks lost 24-22 to Australia at Lang Park last year, when both sides received a red card, and were also defeated by the Wallabies in Perth in 2019 when lock Scott Barrett was sent off for a high tackle during the 47-26 clash. Foster said he had sent lock Brodie Retallick off the training park last week so the All Blacks could practise with 14 men. ""I was thinking he was going to come up and smack me because he didn't think he justified getting a red card,"" he told New Zealand media. ""But we work through those scenarios -- and often your ability to adapt as a team is not so much dependent on your own tactics, it's actually on how the other opposition plays. ""We've learnt the last couple of years playing 'Aussie' with 14 men is not easy to do, because they're very much a fast ruck-and-run team and eventually they'll expose that ... the French probably didn't play that way."" Australia were forced to play for 75 minutes with 14 men in their 33-30 win over France on Saturday after winger Marika Koroibete was controversially sent off at Lang Park for a high tackle on visiting captain Anthony Jelonch. Koroibete's red card was quashed by a judiciary panel on Monday. New Zealand, who swept Fiji in two tests after beating Tonga this month, host the first Bledisloe Cup test against Australia at Eden Park on Aug. 7 as they bid to retain the annual trans-Tasman trophy for a 19th successive year. Hansen said Australia would be feeling good after their 2-1 series win over France and the All Blacks would need to prepare for their ""confrontational-type game"". ""They want to do a lot of stuff at the breakdown to disrupt your flow of ball and if you're not accurate there, you get into a bun-fight,"" he said.

The 24-year-old has won a record 25 world championship medals, 19 of which are gold, and has won every all-around competition she has contested since 2013.  She also won four gold medals, and a bronze, at the Rio Games and is fully expected to add to that tally in Tokyo. ""I'm trying to be better than I was at the last meet, so I'm trying to beat myself,"" Biles told NBC television. ""And so now I'm doing things that were unimaginable to the sport, and even for myself, and it's honestly crazy but I'm really excited because I feel like I've pushed my limits."" Earlier this year Biles became the first woman to land a Yurchenko double-pike vault in competition. Biles, who over the weekend confessed to being bored as she moved from her hotel room to practices under strict coronavirus protocols, on Monday posted a triumphant photo showing her and a team mate in front of a wall at the Olympic Village in Tokyo.

"People queue up to get their picture taken in front of the sunset on top of Shibuya Sky observation deck, ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, in Tokyo, Japan, July 19, 2021.   REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach TOKYO (Reuters) -Major Olympic sponsors will not attend this week's opening ceremony, domestic media said on Tuesday, dealing another blow to a slimmed-down Games as more athletes tested positive for the coronavirus. The Games, postponed last year because of the pandemic, open on Friday but will be held without spectators after Japan this month decided that participants would compete in empty venues to minimise the risk of further infections as cases in Tokyo rise. Officials from top Olympic sponsor Panasonic Corp., as well as Fujitsu Ltd and NEC Corp. will skip the event, several local media outlets said, after Toyota Motor Corp on Monday dropped https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/two-thirds-japanese-doubt-pandemic-olympics-can-be-safe-says-poll-2021-07-19 all TV ads linked to the Games. Public concern has grown that hosting an event with tens of thousands of overseas athletes, officials and journalists could accelerate infection rates in Japan's capital and introduce COVID-19 variants that are more infectious or deadlier. Organisers, for whom International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said cancelling the event had never been an option, have promised to keep the Games ""safe and secure"". But experts see gaps in an Olympic ""bubble"" that mandates frequent testing and has been designed to limit participants' movements. There have been 67 cases https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/coronavirus-incidents-tokyo-olympics-2021-07-15 of COVID-19 infections in Japan among those accredited for the Games since July 1, when many athletes and officials started arriving, organisers said on Tuesday. That does not include those at local training camps. Two members of Mexico's Olympic baseball team tested positive for COVID-19 at the team hotel before their departure for Tokyo, the country's baseball federation said on Tuesday. The athletes, Hector Velazquez and Sammy Solis, who tested positive on July 18, have been isolated, as have all team members pending results of more tests, it said. The first major test of how an Olympics can be held in the midst of a pandemic may well come on Thursday in the men's soccer tournament when Japan face a South Africa side that could struggle to field 11 players due to the coronavirus. Bach said on Tuesday organisers could never have imagined the ""unprecedented challenges"" of bringing the global event to Tokyo, and praised the ""heroic efforts"" of medical personnel and volunteers around the world amid the pandemic. ""The IOC never abandons the athletes. Therefore, we took an unprecedented decision to postpone the Games. Today I can admit we did not know how complex this would be,"" he said. Comments by Bach and other IOC officials have in the run-up to the Games sparked outrage on social media in Japan for appearing to dismiss concerns about the pandemic. Japan's Emperor Naruhito will meet Bach on Thursday, Kyodo news agency reported. Japanese media said Naruhito, who has spoken of his memories of the 1964 Olympics that Tokyo hosted, will attend the opening ceremony on Friday. ""It's obvious that the bubble system is kind of broken,"" said Kenji Shibuya, the former director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London. [L4N2OW0F4] ""My biggest concern is, of course, there will be a cluster of infections in the (athletes') village or some of the accommodation and interaction with local people,"" Shibuya added. Japan has recorded more than 840,000 cases of COVID-19 and 15,055 deaths. Host city Tokyo is experiencing a fresh surge, with 1,387 cases recorded on Tuesday. A rocky vaccination rollout has added to concerns. About one-third of Japan's population has had at least one vaccination shot and about 22% are fully vaccinated, one of the lowest rates among wealthy countries.  Days before the opening ceremony in Tokyo, 68% of respondents in an Asahi newspaper poll expressed doubt about the ability of Olympic organisers to control coronavirus infections, with 55% saying they were opposed to the Games going ahead. A Ugandan weightlifter, Julius Ssekitoleko, who went missing from a Japan-based training camp last week leaving a note saying he wanted to stay in the country Japan, was found on Tuesday, public broadcaster NHK said. There has been no suggestion that he has contracted COVID-19. Bach also said that World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus would be in Tokyo on Wednesday to ""share his thoughts with us in a keynote speech"".

"FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: The logo of Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games that have been postponed to 2021 due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, is seen through a traffic sign at Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office building in Tokyo, Japan January 22, 2021. REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo (Reuters) -     Action at the Tokyo Olympics is scheduled to start on Wednesday as Japan meet Australia in softball with each team holding vastly different stakes in the sport's return to the Games. With the Olympics getting underway a year late because of the COVID-19 pandemic, hosts Japan will throw the first pitch at 0000 GMT in Fukushima. Spectators are banned. It will be an unusual scene for Japanese players, who hail from a domestic professional league that involves cheerleaders, bands and busloads of employees from corporate sponsors. ""Softball is the biggest thing out here. The fans, the competitiveness is unbelievable,"" said Dallas Escobedo, a pitcher for Mexico who has played in the league since last year. But the Australians, who rarely compete before more than spouses and children, will not be fazed by 14,300 empty seats. The gap underscores why winning gold would be more transformative for Australia than any of their five competitors. Although defending champions Japan face pressure to succeed on home turf, softball's popularity in the country won't be threatened whatever the outcome. On the other hand, Australia are aiming to launch their first league within three years, said David Pryles, Softball Australia's chief executive. Proving it has the world's top talent could be essential to attracting backing. Australia have won silver or bronze on the four occasions the sport has been included at the Olympics but never gold. Softball participation fell each time despite the medals, according to Pryles. But he said the pattern may be different this time because of a one-hour time difference with Tokyo, record spending on marketing the team online and extra attention from being the first overseas squad in any sport to arrive in Japan on June 1. It has several sponsors, after having none during softball's last Olympics appearance in 2008. ""For us it’s massive, these Olympics are huge,"" Pryles said.  If Mexico managed to win gold on their softball debut at the Games they could secure long-term government funding. But players from the United States, Italy and Canada foresee minimal impact on their budding leagues from taking gold.  They primarily want to dazzle Olympic organisers so that softball, ruled out for Paris in 2024, returns in 2028. Australia's Pryles believes his players have taken a bigger gamble than many of their competitors. The women gave up weeks of pay for the extensive training in Japan, with stipends replacing only some of their lost income.

"PETALING JAYA: Missing the gold medal at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics was a haunting jolt for China’s men’s gymnasts and they intend to bury the demons of their failure five years ago when the Games start in Japan on Friday. Their gymnastics team were among the third batch of China’s Olympics shooting, tennis, taekwondo, badminton, hockey and boxing team to arrive in Tokyo on Sunday. China, the dominant power in gymnastics at the Olympics, were a pale shadow of their great past when all they could muster were one silver and three bronzes at Rio with their men’s squad winning the bronze in the team’s all-around event. In the 2012 London Olympics, they were all-conquering – winning five golds, four silvers and three bronzes. The men’s team were triumphant in the all-around event. One of their athlete’s comments to China’s Xinhua news echoed the nightmare the team had to endure since their Rio debacle five years ago. “We want to bounce back. We cannot forget what happened in Rio because we did so well in the London Olympics but fared poorly in Rio. We have trained well and made sure we don’t do a Rio repeat,” said star gymnast Xiao Ruoteng, who is eyeing the men’s team gold in Tokyo. Russia’s dynamic duo of Nikita Nagornyy and Artur Dalaloyan will be the favourites in the men’s event. The pair had dominated the men’s side of the sport since 2018 when Dalaloyan took the world all-around title. In 2019, Nagornyy soar to gold medals in the all-around event at the European and World Championships. The pair also helped Russia win their first World team gold medal in 2019. And the Chinese are hoping to upset the apple cart in Tokyo. And they will be banking on 2017 world all-around champion Ruoteng and Sun Wei, who finished fifth in the all-around at the 2019 Worlds, to do it. Malaysia’s challenge lies in the hands of Jeremiah Loo, who is looking to break his personal best of 76.5, which he recorded in the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games, but it would be tough to see him get into medal contention.

"Go all the way: Khairul Anuar Mohamad’s best individual achievement at the Olympics was reaching the quarter-finals in the 2012 London Games. PETALING JAYA: Despite being touted as medal hopefuls for the national contingent, Malaysian archers had fallen short of expectations in the past editions of the Olympics. And it looks unlikely that the outcome is going to be any different this time around in Tokyo. The National Archery Association of Malaysia’s (NAAM) pursuit of the country’s maiden Olympics medal has just gotten a lot trickier following their failure to qualify for the men’s team event. It marked the first time Malaysia missed out on the men’s team event, exclusive to only 12 nations, since Beijing 2008. Malaysia can only count on seasoned campaigner Khairul Anuar Mohamad in the men’s individual competition – but odds are heavily stacked against him given his poor form of late. In the third leg of the World Cup in Paris last month, the world No. 15 could shoot the 34th best score in the ranking round before being sent packing in the third round of the elimination competition. Two weeks before the Paris meet, Khairul fared even worse in the first leg of Asia Cup in Gwangju, South Korea after being handed a humiliating defeat by an unheralded 15-year-old Bangladeshi opponent. But if history is of any indication, Khairul had always been capable of springing a surprise when it is least expected. Just two years ago in Holland, Khairul came agonisingly close to being crowned the world champion after being beaten by American Brady Ellison through a sudden death shoot-off in the final. But it was still a historic feat as no Malaysian had ever won a medal at the world meet. Khairul will have to replicate that sizzling form if he hopes to go far in Tokyo. Khairul’s best individual achievement at the Olympics was reaching the quarter-finals in the 2012 London Games. He matched Cheng Chu Sian’s feat four years earlier in Beijing. In Rio 2016, Khairul shot the 22nd best score before exiting the second round. But being a three-time Olympian, it will not be acceptable if Khairul gets knocked out early once again. He must reach at least the quarter-finals to be considered as a satisfactory outing. Khairul will also compete in the mixed team event with debutant Syaqiera Mashayikh but the duo are not expected to mount a strong challenge given the rookie status of the latter.

"ALREADY a competitive archer at a tender age of 10, Syaqiera Mashayikh grew up enjoying watching films such as “Brave” and “The Hunger Games” trilogy which feature sharpshooting female hero characters Princess Merida and Katniss Everdeen. But come this Friday, the 20-year-old lass hailing from Medoi Felda settlement in Johor, will have her very own story to be told once she releases the first arrow from her recurve bow at Yumenoshima Park in Tokyo. Competing in her maiden Olympics of course is no fantasy like those movies she had watched, but Syaqiera confessed she was left pinching herself “for days” after she was told about her selection for the Tokyo Games. What’s more mind-blowing was that Syaqiera had only joined the national team last year and hasn’t even won a medal even at the Sukma level. In terms of experience, her international debut was the Tokyo 2020 Final Qualification Tournament (FQT) and the third leg of World Cup, both in Paris a month ago. “The news (of being selected) shook me up for quite a while. It took me a few days to actually come to realise that it’s not a dream,” said Segamat-born Syaqiera. “It’s just unbelievable considering the inclusion came barely two weeks after none of us in the (women’s) team managed to qualify on merit through the final qualifiers in Paris. “I know where exactly I stand as a national team rookie. Not only that I have not competed in any international meets until recently, I also have no medal to show from any major tournaments. Under these circumstances, what’s the odds of me making the grade to represent Malaysia at the Olympics?” she asked. Syaqiera and the National Archery Association of Malaysia (NAAM) will have to thank Ivory Coast and New Zealand for returning the two women’s individual quotas they initially won for the Games. As a result, it freed up slots for re-allocations to others on the ranking list and it went to Malaysia and Estonia. Malaysia secured the precious ticket by virtue of having Nur Aliya Ghapar as the next highest-ranked recurve women at No. 58. Aliya is no longer with the national team after bring dropped early last year. Fortunately, the World Archery’s rule states that any quota won is given to the national contingent rather than athletes concerned. Syaqiera certainly deserved her spot as she posted 619 points twice during the FQT and World Cup in Paris to beat minimum standard set for archers at the Olympics (640 points for men and 605 for women). Teammate Nurul Azreena Fazil matched the 619 effort but she only did it once during the FQT. The women’s individual spot was crucial as it enabled Malaysia to qualify for the mixed team event as Khairul Anuar Mohamad had already won the men’s place with his silver medal medal finish at the World Championships in Holland in 2019. Syaqiera is relishing the prospects of teaming up with Khairul, an archer she had looked up to all these years. “Abang Khairul is the face of the national archery team for almost a decade now. I admire him for putting Malaysia on the world map with his excellent results,” said Syaqiera. “It’s a great honour to be competing alongside him in the team event. I admit it’s going to be nervous, but I will try to catch up with him and not let him and the coaches down. “I must make this mixed team playing opportunity worthwhile too. It’s really pleasing to know that I will be competing in two events, rather than one in my Olympics debut.” Syaqiera will become the only third women’s archer to participate at the Olympics after Mon Redee Sut Txi (Athens 2004) and Nurul Syafiqah Hashim (London 2012). But Syaqiera stands a chance of outdoing her predecessors’ record as Mon Redee and Nurul did not make it past the first round. “My target in Tokyo is simple. To beat my personal best score of 619 and try to win my first round match. If I can do that, it’s considered satisfactory already,” she said. “But I certainly believe I’m capable of achieving better results. I would like to use this unforeseen Olympics start to establish myself as world-beater in future. “There’s also the SEA Games (now postponed to next year) and Asian Games coming up, I have to capitalise on every single exposure that I could get to gain invaluable competition experience. “It sounds weird, but I hope that the Tokyo Olympics, which is supposed to be the pinnacle of any archer, will become my a stepping stone towards a great career in archery. “I also look forward to running my own archery club and academy to encourage more people to take up this sport. But first, I’ll need to build some credentials first.” TRUE wireless stereo (TWS) noise-cancelling earbuds come in handy when you want to escape the intrusion of the outside world, block out the distracting sounds of daily life or devote yourself to work without interruption.

"PETALING JAYA: Sailing coach Sahir A. Rahim is one gratified and happy man. Sahir has two budding students who are like “sponges” to him – absorbing what he teaches and perusing the knowledge in their training for Olympics glory. The Malaysian duo down for the 470 class sailing event for the Tokyo Olympics are 20-year-old Juni Karimah Noor Jamali and Nuraisyah Jamil (24). After taking them under his wings for two years, Sahir confidently assessed that they are quick learners and always willing to push themselves in training. Juni and Nuraisyah’s preparation started in 2019, but it was impacted in 2020 as they could not compete in any competitions in Europe due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But training went on, albeit quarantine-based, when they trained at the Langkawi Sailing Centre in Kedah and this year, from March to May, they trained in Desaru, Johor. “Their combination is getting better every day, and I hope these two can spring a surprise in Enoshima Yacht Harbour. They are quick learners and capable of doing something,” said Sahir. “To tune them, I stressed a lot on the basics, and once they got it right, we went to the advance stage in training. They have grasped all of them well, and as a coach, I am happy with them. Motivation wise, they just have to be positive all the time, and from there, they can create some success. It’s their first Olympics, but I believe they can do something special.”Sahir did say that the competition in the 470 category will be tough as three previous medallists are in the fray. Hannah Mills from Britain won gold in 2016 with Saskia Clark but will partner McIntyre Mills in Tokyo. France’s Camille Lecointre, bronze medallist in Rio will pair with Aloise Retomaz, while Holland’s Lobke Berkhout, who won silver in Beijing 2008, will partner Afrodite Zegers in Japan. “To win a medal, they have to be smart and reduce mistakes from the start. Plus, you have to be really strong-willed to do your best. The favourites I reckon would be from Japan, Britain, France and Spain. “Juni and Nuraisyah will just have to implement what they learnt over the two years, and if they do not do anything wrong, they can do something extraordinary.” TRUE wireless stereo (TWS) noise-cancelling earbuds come in handy when you want to escape the intrusion of the outside world, block out the distracting sounds of daily life or devote yourself to work without interruption.

"Formula One F1 - British Grand Prix - Silverstone Circuit, Silverstone, Britain - July 18, 2021 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton celebrates on the podium after winning the race Pool via REUTERS/Lars Baron SILVERSTONE, England (Reuters) -     Lewis Hamilton might not have won his home British Grand Prix on Sunday without the race being halted after he and Red Bull's Max Verstappen collided on the opening lap, according to Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin. The seven-times world champion won his home race for the eighth time, slashing Verstappen's overall lead in the championship from 33 points to eight. Verstappen crashed out at speed, with the damage to the tyre wall requiring a lengthy pause. The red flag period allowed Mercedes to inspect Hamilton's car closely and detect potential damage to the front left wheel rim that had not otherwise been obvious. ""That would have been a DNF (did not finish) had it (the race) not been red-flagged,"" said Shovlin in post-race comments. A Mercedes spokesman clarified however that subsequent checks at the factory showed the rim failure was less conclusive. Hamilton was handed a 10-second penalty for the collision but raced back to seize the lead from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc with two laps to go and win the race. ""You can hear it in his voice and in what he's saying on the radio; you just get this switch where he knows in his head he's going to do it today,"" he said.

"Olympic aim: Goh Liu Ying (front) and Chan Peng Soon are determined to make Malaysia proud as they set their sights on gold. PETALING JAYA: Yobick is going big in rallying support for mixed doubles shuttlers Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying to go one step better in their third Olympic Games in Tokyo. The yogurt-flavoured drink brand has initiated a “Sokong Wira Malaysia’ campaign to get all Malaysian supporters to root for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games silver medallists. And the independent players Peng Soon-Liu Ying are grateful for the strong backing from home. “I would never have persevered all these years without the continuous support from the whole nation who believe in us,” said Liu Ying. “With eyes set on the gold medal in Tokyo, I am determined to make Malaysia proud.” It’s beyond surprise that an injury-prone Liu Ying has managed to qualify for this year’s Olympics but she is determined to make it count. “This is another chance, it makes all those countless practice hours and injuries that I suffered worthwhile,” she said. Peng Soon, a family man to four loving children, believes the sacrifices will be worth it. “It’s the hardest time to miss out on family times and big celebrations but they have been supportive. With all the support, motivation and rigorous training, anything is possible,” said Peng Soon on their chances in a very competitive mixed doubles event. In conjunction with the launch on support for Peng Soon-Liu Ying, Yobick will introduce a new limited edition yoghurt drink, Yamanashi Grape. “The new flavour launch is timely, in hopes that this will give a sense of connectivity among our consumers with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” said Takeshi Suma, chief executive officer of DyDo Drinco Malaysia. Yobick has been a proud sponsor of Peng Soon and Liu Ying since 2019. HELP University offers two Foundation programmes: the Foundation in Arts and Foundation in Science.

"Formula One F1 - British Grand Prix - Silverstone Circuit, Silverstone, Britain - July 18, 2021 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen before the race Pool via REUTERS/Lars Baron LONDON (Reuters) -     Formula One's motorsport head Ross Brawn has urged Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton not to let their title battle boil over after the pair collided in Sunday's British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The first lap clash sent Red Bull's Verstappen crashing out, and on to hospital for checks, while Hamilton fought back from a 10 second penalty to win for Mercedes and slash the gap at the top to eight points. The afternoon ended in argument and accusation, with Hamilton also subjected to racial abuse on social media channels. ""As is always the case in these matters, there will be a wide range of opinions on the rights and wrongs,"" said Brawn in a column for the official Formula One website on Monday. ""What is clear is that we were robbed of a thrilling battle and nobody wants the championship decided on crashes and penalties. ""I hope we can avoid those incidents in the future because I think we were denied a fantastic battle today."" For some, what happened was an accident waiting to happen and also a game-changer that has lit a fuse under a title tussle between the sport's most successful driver and his heir apparent. McLaren boss Zak Brown said already in May that he felt it was ""a matter of time"" before both tangled into the first corner and neither came out.  Andrew Shovlin, Mercedes' head of trackside engineering, expressed a similar opinion on Sunday. It took until turn nine at Silverstone, and it was only Verstappen that did not continue, but the point was made. Hamilton, the seven-times world champion and now winner of his home race a record-extending eight times, showed that when push comes to shove he is not prepared to back down. ""I think this year he (Verstappen) has been very aggressive and most of the times I’ve had to concede and just avoid incident with him and live to fight on later in the race,"" said the 36-year-old Briton. ""Once he's out in the clear, they're too fast so when an opportunity comes, I've got to try and take it. That's what we're out there doing."" What happened on Sunday followed a pattern in close title battles -- reminiscent of the elbows-out duels of old between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost or more recently Hamilton v Nico Rosberg. Hamilton and Verstappen had been complimentary enough about each other early in the campaign but the tone is different after 10 races. Hamilton and Mercedes highlighted Verstappen's 'aggressive' driving while Red Bull accused the Briton of a dangerous and desperate move. The bigger picture is that the heat has been turned up, the battle lines are drawn and things are likely to get a lot more lively. Hamilton hoped they could still find ""the best balance"" and give each other ""space and respect... so that we can continue racing and have good races without colliding"", but that may be wishful thinking. History shows that the more there is at stake, the more tempers are likely to rise and rivalries boil over. Hamilton wants that record eighth title, one more than Michael Schumacher, and Dutch 23-year-old Verstappen wants to be his country's first champion. Neither are about to blink or flinch, two of the most mentally tough and determined drivers in a battle all of their own.

It however, could also end up as one to be forgotten if their players wilt under the pressure and expectations to perform at their own backyard. The 56-year-old Joo-bong, who has led the team since the 2008 Beijing Olympics, admitted it was tricky. “Over the past 1½ years, there have been many changes in the training and competition schedule of the national team due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Joo-bong. “Despite all the setbacks, the Japanese team have steadily prepared for the Olympics. Players have either had training at their respective clubs or at the national centre.” “As the coach of the Japanese badminton team, I’m very lucky to lead Japan to their fourth Olympics in Japan, but it is a burden too. “But I plan to participate in the tournament with a happy heart.” Joo-bong, who won South Korea’s first badminton Olympics gold medal with Kim Moon-soo in the men’s doubles at the 1992 Barcelona Games, has transformed the landscape and image of Japan badminton over a decade. From the minnows of badminton, they are now the giants of the sport that used to be dominated by China, Indonesia and South Korea. In the first Olympics under the newly hired Joo-bong then at the 2008 Beijing Games, they fired blanks but then came the progress. They struck their first Olympics medal – a silver through Mizuki Fujii-Reika Kakiiwa in the women’s doubles at the 2012 London Games. At the 2016 Rio Games, Japan won their first Olympics gold through Misaki Matsutomo-Ayaka Takahashi in the women’s doubles and Nozomi Okuhara took the bronze in the women’s singles. For the Tokyo edition, they have the strongest, the biggest and a team with the most depth. Do not be surprised if they win a medal in every event at the Games. China are the only team to have won all five gold medals in one Olympics when they pulled off the incredible feat at the 2012 London Games. But at their home Games in Beijing in 2008, China raked three out of the five at stake. Can Japan be the first to make a clean sweep of all five at home?

"South Korean Flags and signs hang on the appartment building hosting Olympics participants, at the Athletes Village, where a person has tested positive for COVID-19, ahead of Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan July 17,  2021. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon TOKYO (Reuters) -     The South Korean team has removed banners with an historic reference to a past conflict with Japan from their Olympic village accommodation balconies in Tokyo, the International Olympic Committee said on Saturday. The banners had been hung from the team's balconies in the Olympic village, home to the 10,500 athletes from more than 200 countries who will compete at the Games starting next week. ""I have been informed that the banners have been taken down by the South Korean Olympic Committee,"" IOC President Thomas Bach told a news conference. ""This obviously happened on the request of the IOC because the guidelines are also saying very clearly that the Olympic village is one of the protected areas where the athletes can live peacefully together without having to face any kind of divisive messages,"" he said. This is not the first time the two countries have been at odds over flags and symbols during the Olympics. Despite having normalised ties in 1965, relations between the two countries have often been strained, largely over Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula in the past. At the 2018 winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the roles were reversed with Japan complaining over fans waving a Korean peninsula flag depicting disputed islands in the sea between the two nations known as Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese. South Korea also asked the IOC in 2019 to bar Japan from using the ""Rising Sun"" flag at the Games, a symbol of Japan’s imperialist past.

"Young and dangerous: China divers (from left) Zhang Jiaqi, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi will be competing in their first Olympics. PETALING JAYA: It was in Barcelona in 1992 when platform diver Fu Mingxia stunned the sporting world by becoming the youngest ever Olympics champion for China at the age of 13. And almost three decades later, China look set to unleash another teen wonder at the Tokyo Olympics in 14-year-old Quan Hongchan from Zhangjiang. She has been confirmed as the second Chinese diver for the women’s 10m platform individual alongside reigning world champion Chen Yuxi, who herself will only turn 16 after the Olympics. The Tokyo Games will be Hongchan’s international debut as she has never been seen outside of China so far. Having turned 14 only in March, she is half the age of Malaysia’s Pandelela Rinong (28), Canada’s Meaghan Benfeito (32) and Australia’s Melissa Wu (29), whom are expected to be the strongest rivals to China in the women’s 10m platform individual event. The fact that there is no place for the reigning Olympics champion Ren Qian in China’s 10-member strong final squad for Tokyo speaks volumes of the sheer talent on display. Ren Qian, who became the youngest Olympics champion in Rio de Janeiro when she won the women’s 10m platform individual title at the age of 15, was already in danger of missing out after she lost out to Yuxi and Hongchan in China’s national diving championship held in Shanghai last month. For the women’s 10m platform synchro, China will put their faith on Yuxi to pair up with Zhang Jiaqi to deliver the gold. Jiaqi is already a world champion diver herself as she partnered Lu Wei to a comfortable win over Pandelela-Leong Mun Yee in the women’s 10m platform synchro event at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships in Gwangju, South Korea. Former Malaysian head coach Yang Zhuliang, who follows closely the Chinese national diving scene, said it would be a very interesting battle in the women’s 10m platform individual competition. “There is a new girl from China whom the world has not seen yet. She is very, very stable and has not lost back home, that’s why they are giving her the Olympics spot,” he said. “She was picked after winning three competitions in China. And at the national championships which served as the Olympics trial, she won with over 440 points. “It is always very hard to beat the China women divers unless they make a mistake. But we fight like always,” commented Zhuliang, who is now preparing 2017 world champion platform diver Cheong Jun Hoong for the Tokyo mission. It is also worth noting that Hongchan would not have had the chance to make her Olympics appearance if the Tokyo Games had not been postponed by one year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was after Fu Mingxia’s win in Barcelona that the governing body of the sport later ruled that divers must be at least 14 to compete in future Olympics. Except for Hongchan, the other nine members in China’s team are either already Olympics or world champions. This includes Shi Tingmao and Wang Han, who are expected to turn the women’s 3m springboard competition into a private battle.

"FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - British Grand Prix - Silverstone Circuit, Silverstone, Britain - July 18, 2021 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton celebrates on the podium after winning the race Pool via REUTERS/Lars Baron (Reuters) -Lewis Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse online after winning the British Grand Prix, with social media firm Facebook saying on Monday it had removed a number of comments on Instagram. The seven-times world champion celebrated a record eighth British Grand Prix victory on Sunday at Silverstone after fighting back from a 10-second penalty for a first-lap collision that ended up with title rival Max Verstappen in hospital. The 36-year-old Mercedes driver was targeted online hours after the victory, with racist messages including monkey emojis sent as replies to a post by his Mercedes team on Instagram. ""The racist abuse directed at Hamilton during and after the British Grand Prix is unacceptable and we've removed a number of comments from Instagram,"" a spokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram, said in a statement. ""In addition to our work to remove comments and accounts that repeatedly break our rules, there are safety features available, including comment filters and message controls, which can mean no one has to see this type of abuse. ""No single thing will fix this challenge overnight but we're committed to the work to keep our community safe from abuse."" In a joint statement, Mercedes, Formula One and motor sports governing body the FIA condemned the abuse of Hamilton and sought punishment for those guilty. ""These people have no place in our sport and we urge that those responsible should be held accountable for their actions,"" the statement read. ""Formula One, the FIA, the drivers and teams are working to build a more diverse and inclusive sport and such unacceptable instances of online abuse must be highlighted and eliminated."" Verstappen's Red Bull team, who had strongly criticised Hamilton's driving on Sunday, joined the condemnation. ""While we may be fierce rivals on track, we are all united against racism,"" the team said in a statement. ""We condemn racist abuse of any kind towards our team, our competitors and our fans. ""As a team we are disgusted and saddened to witness the racist abuse Lewis endured yesterday on social media after the collision with Max.  ""There is never any excuse for it, there is certainly no place for it in our sport and those responsible should be held accountable."" Hamilton has been a vocal advocate for social justice and among the supporters of the 'Black Lives Matter' movement. He said before the race he was inspired by the reaction of England soccer players to racist abuse after their penalty shootout defeat by Italy in this month's European Championship final. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson met social media firms last week to ask them to step up the fight against online abuse.

"Learning from one another: (from left) Goh Liu Ying, Chen Tang Jie and Chan Peng Soon posing for a photograph after their training session. PETALING JAYA: Mixed doubles shuttler Chen Tang Jie is even more inspired to become an Olympian after a short training stint with seniors Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying. The 23-year-old Tang Jie’s job as a sparring partner for independent shuttlers Peng Soon-Liu Ying over a six-week period ended at the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) just hours before the Rio Olympic Games silver medallists Peng Soon-Liu Ying and the rest of the badminton team members left for Tokyo for the Olympic Games yesterday. Tang Jie said his admiration for Peng Soon-Liu Ying continues to grow because of the latter’s commitment in training. “I’ve learnt a lot of things from them. I got to see how they prepared for the major Games and how they analysed their opponents when the draw was released,” said Tang Jie. “I sure hope to be fit like Peng Soon. He can last so long on court although he is 33. He is really patient on court. “He has not gone back home with his family during this quarantine training but he is so focused when he is training alone. “Liu Ying is also so tough. She has gone through several serious injuries but continues to stay strong and keeps fighting. It’s not easy to come back after an operation but she proved that she can. But more than their devotion on court, Tang Jie is more appreciative of Peng Soon-Liu Ying’s friendship. “I am touched because of their willingness to teach me. When training is over, both will stay back to just train a little bit extra with my partner Peck Yen Wei and I,” said Tang Jie. “They tell us what our shortcomings are and give us tips to be better. They don’t rush back quickly to their rooms when the training is over. “I’m so thankful I got this opportunity to spar with them. I wish them success in Tokyo and hope they will truly enjoy themselves.” Now that he has benefited from the sparring session, Tang Jie is more determined to feature in his first Olympics at the next edition in Paris in 2024. “They’ve put a strong desire in me to play in the Olympics. I will work hard with my partner under my coach Paulus Firman to qualify for the next Olympics,” added Tang Jie.

"PETALING JAYA: Malaysian platform diver Cheong Jun Hoong (pic) has delayed her trip to Tokyo by one week to give her more time to prepare for the Olympics. Her teammates Pandelela Rinong, Leong Mun Yee, Wendy Ng Yan Yee and Nur Dhabitah Sabri have arrived in Tokyo with other members of the Malaysian contingent yesterday. But the 2017 world champion diver is only leaving on July 25. Her coach Yang Zhuliang said Jun Hoong needed every extra bit of training for the women’s 10m platform individual slated from Aug 4-5. “Her event is starting later and there is no point for her to go so early,” said Zhuliang. “Even if we go there early, it’s not great for her either as it is not the most ideal training situation in Tokyo right now. “It’s better to stay back for a week and get some extra training before heading over. It’ll benefit her.” The competition for diving starts on July 25 with the women’s 3m springboard synchro event. Jun Hoong made a successful comeback after three years on the sidelines due to a knee surgery when she made the top 18 in the 10m platform individual event at the Diving World Cup in May to book her Olympics ticket.

"PETALING JAYA: The spirit of the Olympic Games is alive. Instead of a sombre environment due to concerns over Covid-19 pandemic, the Malaysia badminton team arrived in Tokyo yesterday to a lively Games Village surroundings. “It does feel like Olympic Games here,” said national coaching director Wong Choong Hann. “We were welcomed at different stations by friendly officials ready to serve. All were busy with their duties. Our team have all settled down. “All athletes and officials have taken their swab tests and all turned out to be negative. The badminton players will begin their first day training today. “We will be under a restricted movement phase for the first few days. “We can’t roam freely yet but for now, we are only allowed to the dining hall, training centre and our rooms,” he said. Based on the posts shared by some of the national athletes on social media, it is clearly evident that they are all thrilled to bits to finally be at the Games Village. They shared clips of the interior designs and bedroom decorations, with the one that stole the show being their beds which were made from recyclable cardboard, besides showing off the stunning views from their bedrooms.

"IN less than a week, all eyes will be on Japan, a country that promises the best Olympics action despite the Covid-19 challenges. In Malaysia, there is one burning question – can we finally nail our first gold medal? Or maybe even two? We have been sending a team to the Olympics since the 1956 Melbourne Games and we struck our first medal when badminton was introduced as an Olympics sport at the 1992 Barcelona edition. That was when the famous Sidek brothers – Razif and Jalani – won a men’s doubles bronze medal but our neighbours Indonesia upstaged us to take their first-ever Olympics golds through lovebirds Alan Budi Kusuma (men’s singles) and Susi Susanti (women’s singles.) Indonesia have gone on to add another five golds in badminton. Malaysia, meanwhile, have collected a total of 11 medals since then – eight from badminton, two from diving, and one from cycling – but have not seen the glitter of gold. Lee Chong Wei was the top performer, of course, with three silvers from the last three editions in Beijing (2008), London (2012) and Rio de Janeiro (2016.) Rio was a Games to remember when we nicked four silvers (three badminton, one diving) and one bronze (cycling). There will be 30 Malaysian athletes in Tokyo, two fewer than in the Rio team but the smaller number does not in any way mean poorer quality. Indonesia, with their huge population, are only sending 28 athletes. What matters is quality. On paper, we stand a chance in cycling, diving, archery, and badminton. Rio bronze medallist Azizulhasni Awang has been shaping up so well. His physique is more impressive now, he has a better bike, he has focused on nutrition and he is even taking his own pillow and specially designed mattress to make sure he gets a good night’s sleep. One has to just read his Facebook posting filled with war cries and positive sayings. It’s so motivating and inspiring that even I have restarted my morning runs (although that’s on hold no thanks to the Covid-19 restrictions). He is determined and positive, I do hope Azizul’s effort will be rewarded with the gold he is looking for. It will not be easy as his taller and bigger opponents in cycling are ridiculously strong too but he has beaten them all before and the Pocket Rocketman is not one to be intimidated. In diving, we can count on pool darlings Pandelela Rinong, Leong Mun Yee and Cheong Jun Hoong to overcome the strong Chinese divers for the top prize. For once, badminton may not be our forte. But there is Lee Zii Jia. Malaysia probably would have discarded badminton as a medal contender if not for the strong showing by Zii Jia en route to winning the All-England title in March. And based on the draw, this could be his potential pathway to the final - defending champion Chen Long of China in the last 16, second seed Chou Tien-chen of Taiwan in the quarter, Anthony Ginting of Indonesia or Anders Antonsen of Denmark in the semis, and either Kento Momota of Japan or Viktor Axelsen of Denmark in the final. Besides Zii Jia, there are the young and dangerous Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik in the men’s doubles; old-timers Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying, who are equally determined to go one step better than their silver-medal effort in Rio; and Soniia Cheah and Lee Meng Yean-Chow Mei Kuan who want to make a difference in the women’s events. The morale of the national badminton team is also high, largely due to the positive vibe that has been instilled by coaching director Wong Choong Hann and his team since he took over in late 2018. The others in the contingent are not expected to do well but don’t write off top archer Khairul Anuar Mohamad. I believe he has the potential to pull off a surprise. He has the experience and has consistently shown improvement under Korean coach Lee Jae-hyung - he just has to believe in himself. For the first time, there are more Malaysian women athletes in the Olympics, it does not matter that some of them are there as wildcards. Their presence in the Olympics itself is an indication of an achievement that many of us can only dream about. The nation will come together again to rally behind the athletes and pray for their safety as they battle for honour and against Covid-19 in this unprecedented Olympics. I was at the 2004 Athens Olympics and watched Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia being crowned as the men’s singles champion. He shed tears of joy while we were all heartbroken as Malaysia returned empty-handed that year. We came so close in Rio. Will we finally shed tears of joy this time?

"THE Malaysian contingent will leave for their Olympic Games assignment without their chef de mission for the first time. Datuk Lee Chong Wei will stay back as he does not want to take the risk of affecting his health; after all, he had recovered from nose cancer not too long ago and does not want a relapse. He will manage the team from home - probably advising and motivating Malaysia’s 30 athletes – a smaller number of qualifiers compared to the previous edition in Rio four years ago. If that is not bizarre enough, then be prepared for all other unusual situations at the Tokyo Games, which will start on July 23 with the opening ceremony. There won’t be any fans to welcome the march past of athletes from 200 over countries. Over 10,000 athletes will be competing in empty venues, there will be no socialising or training at all on the first three days after arriving in Tokyo as they will be under quarantine. Indeed, it’s going to be a strange Olympics as Japan insists on plodding ahead with the biggest sporting spectacle despite Covid-19 ravaging the country. Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was forced to resort to banning spectators just two weeks before the Games was scheduled to start after announcing that Tokyo’s fourth state of emergency will begin on Monday. Even the opening ceremony on July 23, usually a pompous affair and a symbol of great pride for the hosts, will also be reduced to a television event only. The Japanese organisers are wary of the sentiment of the local residents who had not been in favour of staging an event of this scale in the midst of a national health crisis. The public had valid concerns that the arrival of tens of thousands of athletes, officials and support staff could trigger a new wave of infections. For the athletes, it is basically going to be an extension of their daily routine in isolation. For national diver Pandelela Rinong, she has been living in and out of a training bubble in Bukit Jalil for the past one year and she can’t even return to her home, which is just nearby. It is certainly not good for her mental health but that is what she has to go through to fight for glory for Malaysia in her sport. The worst thing than can happen to Pandelela and other experienced athletes is to make the long arduous trip to Tokyo and not get to compete for breaching the SOPs. They have to be extremely careful. It is not an easy time to be an athlete as you do not just need to be physically and mentally prepared, but also have to constantly worry over your shoulders whether you have been exposed to the virus. Which is why it is timely for top Malaysian officials, including Youth and Sports Minister Datuk Seri Reezal Merican Naina Merican, to preach for fellow Malaysians to get behind the athletes and show support. “I am impressed with them, they went through hell, being far from family but they are doing it for the country,” said Reezal. The public have a right to demand for results but the expectations must also be in balance with the current scenario in a world that is dealing with the pandemic situation last experienced 100 years ago. Criticism is the last thing an athlete should be dealing with right now. LAW graduates have many career options. The most obvious is in the legal profession as an advocate and solicitor.

"ONE often hears of successes or failures of world class athletes but what usually goes unnoticed are the countless hours of hard work they put in and the sacrifices they make. Not to mention the physical pain, tears over injuries and emotional struggles they deal with behind the scene. It’s no different with our top athletes who are currently going through their final three weeks of preparation for Tokyo Olympic Games. Former world keirin champion Azizulhasni Awang is now away from his family in Melbourne. The cyclist is back home with teammate Mohd Shah Firdaus Sahrom for the final phase training camp in Nilai. Azizul, known as the “Pocket Rocketman” shared an emotional moment before bidding goodbye to his children. It was a heart-wrenching time as he knows it would take months before he gets to see them again. Due to traveling restrictions imposed by Australia, Azizul may only get to see them in October. His state of mind is understandable. The father of two young daughters is very close to his family. His daily life routine in Melbourne is alternated between training and spending time with the family. But Azizul knows that this is one of the sacrifices that he has to make to get it right in his fourth Olympic Games. He is aiming to end an elusive chase for a gold medal after winning a bronze at the 2016 Rio edition. “It will not be that easy to return to Australia and the earliest I may see them is after the world championships sometime in October,” said Azizul. “I’m very close to my daughters as I help them with their homework and we do activities together too. “All the fatigue from training vanishes when my children dash to greet me when I come home from the velodrome. “They didn’t want me to leave them for months but I told them that I have a big mission to accomplish for the country.” For badminton mixed doubles specialist Chan Peng Soon, it’s a case of so close yet so far with his family. The father of four children is unable to see his children too and for now, his handphone is the most important asset as he uses it to connect with his loved ones. Peng Soon and his partner Goh Liu Ying have been training under a quarantine bubble system along with the rest of the national shuttlers at the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) in Bukit Kiara since the third phase of movement control order. It is his wife May May who is now doubling up as the father to their four children. So is diver Pandelela Rinong who has not seen her family back in Bau, Sarawak for more than a year because of the Covid-19 situation. It was especially tough for the Bidayuh lass last year as she even had to skip the Christmas celebration with her family in her hometown – a tradition that she had held proudly until last year. Hats off to our dedicated athletes Pandelela, Peng Soon, Azizul and the many other equally determined athletes who continue to teach us about perseverance and commitment to achieve goals despite difficult circumstances.

"The 'special' durian that landed on Wan Mahussin's car. — WAN MAHUSSIN WAN ZAIN A man in Shah Alam, Selangor, has gone viral after uploading a video in which he jokingly offered a durian for sale for RM500, claiming that it was special because the fruit never hit the ground. Instead, the durian landed a devastating blow when it fell on his car and smashed the rear windshield. “The durian was from a tree that we have in front of my house and we usually have a netting to catch it before it hits the ground. However, this durian may have fallen through a small gap and landed on my car instead,” Wan Mahussin Wan Zain, 27, said when contacted by  When the incident occurred on July 11 in the morning, Wan Mahussin said he was upset, especially when he found out that the cost to fix the rear windshield on his three-year-old car was around RM500. “I decided to make a video where I offered the durian for RM500 just for fun, as a way to make myself feel better. I uploaded the video onto a Facebook group where local small farmers usually gather to talk about produce,” he said. Wan Mahussin’s video was then shared by other users on social media where it has garnered over 300,000 views after it was uploaded onto one Twitter account. “I got a lot of different reactions. Some said it was good that I never lost my cool, while some people got upset with me as well because they didn’t watch the full video. Later they apologised and said the video made them laugh,” he said. It also caught the attention of Human Resources Minister Datuk Sri M. Saravanan, who reached out to Wan Mahussin to purchase the durian on Sunday (July 18). “I got a call from the minister who said he really wanted to purchase the durian to try it. But I told him that I’ve already eaten it with my family and never intended to sell it,” he said. Wan Mahussin added that the minister offered to send him money anyway to help bear the cost of his car repairs. “Yes, he sent more than what I needed. I used the rest of the money to help people through my Dapur Lockdown initiative to feed the needy in my area,” he said. A check with the Ministry of Human Resources confirmed that Saravanan did indeed reach out to Wan Mahussin personally to purchase his durian. Wan Mahussin said he is happy to be able to make people laugh during the pandemic through his spontaneous video. “I’ve even had people congratulating me cause I’ve made durian kampung more desirable than the usual expensive types. Luckily, the durian that hit my car was tasty or else I’ll be crying again,” he said. ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) holds a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol following a private visit to the Holocaust Museum, to express contrition for previous remarks about Jewish people, in Washington, U.S. June 14, 2021. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein  (Corrects the second paragraph to include all under 65, not just non-obese under 65) (Reuters) -Twitter Inc on Monday said it temporarily suspended Republican U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's account for tweets which violated the social media's misinformation policy on COVID-19. Greene posted that the coronavirus is not dangerous for non-obese people and those under 65, and that organizations should not force ""non-FDA"" approved vaccines or masks. These tweets have been labeled as ""misleading"" by the platform. The United States is using vaccines made by Pfizer Inc, Moderna Inc and Johnson & Johnson under Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization. None of these vaccines are fully approved but numerous studies have proven their efficacy. U.S. President Joe Biden has called on the social media companies to take action on vaccine misinformation. ""We took enforcement action on the account @mtgreenee for violations of the Twitter Rules, specifically the COVID-19 misleading information policy,"" a Twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Greene's account will remain locked for 12 hours, according to Twitter. In a video statement on Facebook Live, Greene acknowledged that she had been temporarily suspended from the platform and blamed the Biden administration for trying to control free speech. ""Remember, last week when our press secretary said the White House is working to stop the spread of (misinformation) because they want to be careful and they want to be in control of the information that is shared about COVID-19 and vaccines, isn’t that concerning?"" Greene said. The Republican representative has come under fire before for remarks on the pandemic. In June she apologized after comparing COVID-19 mask requirements and vaccinations to the Holocaust that killed 6 million Jews. In January, Twitter locked Greene's account after she sparred with a state election official over voter fraud allegations.

"MYMedic@Wilayah Vaccination Trucks parked in front of Sogo Complex to inoculate workers of businesses in Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman and Masjid India. — LOW LAY PHON/The Star BUSINESSES in the shopping enclaves of Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman (TAR) and Masjid India hope to see a resurgence of interest in shopping now that their workforce is being vaccinated. About 1,000 people from various businesses received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine through the MYMedic@Wilayah Vaccination Truck initiative by Federal Territories Ministry. The vaccination programme was carried out in front of Sogo Complex in Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Kuala Lumpur, yesterday. Batu Road Retailers Association (Barra) president Datuk Andrew Lim Tatt Keong said the objective of the exercise was to speed up vaccination of workers in the essential and non-essential sectors in the area. “We hope we will soon be allowed to operate with minimal restrictions but strict standard operating procedure in place,” he said in a statement. Lim said while they had 1,000 workers who registered this time, it was important that the remaining 8,000 to 10,000 people from businesses along Jalan TAR and Masjid India be fully vaccinated. He said that under phase one of the programme, Barra with the support of its anchor member KL Sogo aimed to be the first standalone department store in Kuala Lumpur to have all their workers fully vaccinated. “KL Sogo offered to host the venue and we appreciate the management’s support and assistance in this vaccination programme,” he said. Lim said Barra, together with the Masjid India Business Association (Miba), would work with the ministry and Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) to ensure that the shopping district achieved the target of getting 75% of its workforce vaccinated by the middle of next month. “We and the associations representing traders and businesses in Jalan TAR and Masjid India are optimistic about the National Recovery Plan,” he added. Meanwhile, Miba president Datuk Ameer Ali Mydin hoped the vaccination exercise would include walk-ins from other communities in Masjid India and Jalan TAR. “There are immigrants and other vulnerable groups here who should be able to utilise this service to get vaccinated.” He said businesses were badly hit after Malayan Mansion and Selangor Mansion were placed under the enhanced movement control order in April last year. “We have yet to recover and the lockdowns that followed have not helped. “Hopefully, this will increase shoppers’ confidence to come to the area,” he said.

"Shoplots at Station 18 in Jalan Pengkalan Barat, Ipoh, have been lying empty for a long time. 
— Photos: RONNIE CHIN / The Star Empty and unkempt houses and shoplots are a common sight at several areas in Ipoh, Perak. Residents say this has been an ongoing problem for years. While some of these buildings were abandoned, others had been put up for sale but there were no buyers. In addition to being an eyesore, these vacant buildings have brought about a host of other problems. One affected area is Sungai Rokam where about 10 houses on Jalan Mawar, Jalan Perah, Jalan Rokam and Jalan Salak have been abandoned. A teacher, who wished to be known only as Amy, said one of her neighbours had moved out and left his house empty for several years. “When the compound became overgrown with trees and shrubs, my family and I became worried about rodents, reptiles and other animals. “We tried to call the owner to clear the area but we could not reach him. “He never came to check the house nor did he ensure the surroundings were maintained,” she added. Amy said her mother had once seen a snake in their compound, which she believed had come from her neighbour’s house. ”We called the Fire and Rescue Department and they caught the reptile. “My brother and father have put up special blinds at each window to prevent any creepy crawlies from entering. “We had to do away with our small garden too as we feared it had become a habitat for snakes,” she said. Amy said a new tenant moved into the house last year and found that it was infested with rats. “It took them a long time to clean the house and make it habitable,” she added. Another Sungai Rokam resident, Nurhanida Yang Razali, said there were at least three abandoned houses near her home at Jalan Mawar. “I have been staying here for 40 years and we have had several bad experiences due to these abandoned houses. “There have been times when snakes slithered into my compound,” she said. “The homeowner hired a contractor to clean up the premises some time ago but it has been quite a while since it was maintained properly. “I have contacted the Ipoh City Council about the problem,” she added. Nurhanida noted some owners had passed away, and the houses were left empty ever since. “I know one of the owners and his children are working in another state. “The house has been put up for sale, but I don’t think there are any interested buyers,” she said. Another house near her home used to have a tenant but they only stayed for a short time and the property is empty again, said Nurhanida. In Klebang Putra, resident Maryanti Misrawi said she was concerned about the vandalism taking place at empty shoplots located about 200m from her house. “I think only two of the shops are open for business and the rest have been left empty. “I even saw some burnt furniture there while the walls are covered with graffiti. “I am worried for my safety as well as that of my neighbours,” said the 29-year-old, adding she hopes the city council would clean up the area. Another resident, Muhammad Al-Hafiz Mohd Nur Helmi Chai, 26, believes the shoplots have been vacant for years. “Some of these lots were used by drug addicts, vandalised and are strewn with rubbish. “It’s been like that for years, probably because there is not much traffic here,” he said. Muhamamd Al-Hafiz suggests that the city council resurface the road from Klebang Putra-Chepor Impian to Meru. “That way, more cars will use the road and maybe that will encourage more businesses to set up shop here.” He said although there was a “rat lane” from Klebang Putra-Chepor Impian to Meru, it was filled with potholes. “If there is a proper road to connect these two areas, things may change for the better. “When that happens, I hope there will be barbers, electrical shops and more here,” he added. When contacted, a city council spokesman said compound notices would be issued to owners who failed to maintain their premises. “The public may contact our hotline to report unkempt premises, the city council will work together with the land office to track down the owners. “We will give the owners between 14 and 21 days to clean up their premises. “If they fail to do so, our appointed contractor will clean it and send the bill to the owner,” said the spokesman, adding that this is provided for under Section 82 of the Local Government Act 1976 (Act 171). Meanwhile, Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association (Rehda) national council member Tony Khoo said vacant houses still had value and could be sold. “The owners, however, need to renovate these properties before putting them up for sale. “A refurbished house will be more attractive and there is also no need for buyers to get another loan to renovate the premises. “Sadly, many of these private properties have been left idle and are now overgrown with weeds,” he added. As for vacant shoplots, Khoo, who is former Perak Rehda chairman, said these could ideally be converted into accommodation for workers. “There are many vacant shoplots in Station 18. These can be turned into workers’ quarters or hostels. “The downside though, is that the utility charges, quit rent and assessment, will be higher,” he said. He called on the city council and Tenaga Nasional Bhd to look into this and come up with a workable solution. On the reason for empty shoplots in certain areas, Khoo attributed it to market saturation. “I believe that a proper survey should be done before any new development is approved in an area,” he added.

"UEM Sunrise representatives arranging packets of essential items for 
distribution to the families. PROPERTY developer UEM Sunrise provided essentials to 500 families in Segambut, Kuala Lumpur. The contribution was the latest under the company’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) effort to support groups and communities affected by Covid-19. The beneficiary families were from Kampung Segambut Dalam, which was under enhanced movement control order at the time of donation, and Kampung Masjid Segambut. With residents under strict lockdown rules, UEM Sunrise representatives led by its chief executive officer Sufian Abdullah, Segambut MP Hannah Yeoh and Welfare Department officers placed the items for 250 families at the operations centre in Kampung Segambut Dalam. Sufian said the company would do its best to assist groups and frontliners in such difficult times. “It is imperative that we support our communities and we hope that our contributions will lessen their worries,” he added. The group also distributed supplies to another 250 families in Kampung Masjid Segambut. Yeoh commended the developer for lending a hand in making sure that the most affected communities were not left behind. “In times when resources are stretched, I am heartened that UEM Sunrise and other corporations and non-governmental organisations have stepped up to ensure the communities who are in need the most, do not go hungry during this challenging period,” she said. UEM Sunrise had previously organised two programmes –- the distribution of essential items to residents of Kampung Orang Asli Simpang Arang in Gelang Patah, Johor, and a cash contribution to Pertubuhan Nur Kasih Bestari Orphanage in Kajang, Selangor. Last year, it made donations to the Malaysian Relief Agency and Malaysian Red Crescent Society in Johor, as well as to Hospital Kuala Lumpur for the purchase of personal protective equipment, face masks, medical equipment and a ventilator.

"Unlike many other forms of phone hacking, Pegasus could be delivered to a user by a maliciously crafted message or attachment that could infect a user’s device, simply by ‘processing’ the received attachment. In some cases, users were infected simply by calling the user – the spyware was able to delete the call log to cover its tracks. — Photo by  Pegasus, the spyware that is used to target and snoop on users via their smartphones came into the news in 2019 when WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned cryptomessenger sued the Israeli company behind the software, called NSO Group after it was discovered that more than a thousand users were allegedy being targeted around the world, according to reports. To understand what Pegasus is and how it worked in the past, it is necessary to understand how the software was used to target individuals and how the affected companies changed their services to fix the security flaws being used by Pegasus back in 2019. Pegasus is a software tool created by the NSO Group, a form of spyware that can be used to target a person, gain control of their mobile device and compromise their privacy and security. Unlike many other forms of phone hacking, Pegasus could be delivered to a user by a maliciously crafted message or attachment that could infect a user’s device, simply by “processing” the received attachment. In some cases, users were infected simply by calling the user – the spyware was able to delete the call log to cover its tracks. On targeted devices, the software could gather information including monitoring keystrokes (passwords) call and location monitoring, as well as phone calls, SMS, calendar events, and other data from encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp. According to Kaspersky, it could also be turned into a spyware device, by using the camera and microphone remotely. Pegasus is very expensive software and the company behind the spyware has previously claimed that they do not sell the software except to authorised governments to combat terror and crime. It is unlikely that the average WhatsApp user has been targeted by Pegasus, while WhatsApp had also alerted users it believed were affected by the spyware after it was first reported. At the time, Apple had issued a quick security patch to resolve the security flaw, while WhatsApp had also patched its app to secure users, both on iOS and on Android, so it is unlikely that users will have to worry about their safety at this point. However, no system is inherently hack-proof, so it is best to keep your apps and system completely up to date to ensure that it is secure at all times. – The Hindustan Times, New Delhi/Tribune News Service LAW graduates have many career options.

"TO HELP strengthen Malaysia’s healthcare system amid the recent surge in the number of Covid-19 patients, Maybank has pledged RM14mil to urgently upgrade two government hospitals to ensure the continued provision of adequate medical facilities and services. The contribution, to be channelled via Mercy Malaysia’s Covid-19 Hospital Surge Capacity Support Programme, will see the deployment of critically needed equipment and personnel to Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) and Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah in Klang (HTAR), beginning next week. Maybank chairman Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa said the group, like all other Malaysians, viewed with concern the increasing number of Covid-19 patients and the resulting strain on the country’s medical infrastructure. “We recognise the challenges faced by our hospitals and heroic frontliners, as well as the anguish of the patients and their loved ones who may face delays in receiving medical attention because of the overwhelming number of cases. “Given the pressing requirements at these two hospitals, we felt it was essential that all efforts be made to alleviate the critical need for medical support and offer relief to both the patients and frontliners there.” Mercy Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said they were honoured by the continued support from Maybank. “The latest funding is testament to the recognition for and trust that Maybank has in our work as a non-profit organisation in delivering emergency humanitarian response.” Zamzamzairani said the programme would be carried out over an estimated 20-week period through a three-pronged approach. This will be through the provision of health equipment and supplies as well as mobilisation of human resources and technical training including mental health and psychosocial support. “It will result in the ICU bed capacity for Category 4 and 5 Covid-19 patients increasing by six units in HTAR and 10 units in HKL, as well as an additional 200 Covid-19 patient beds at each of these two hospitals. “At the same time, it will provide critically needed health workers and support staff totalling 40 personnel for HTAR and 50 for HKL, to serve at both their Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 wards, enabling their outpatient departments to reopen and serve all patients.” This initiative will also see more medical staff trained on the proper handling of Covid-19 cases as well as provide a wide range of ICU and non-ICU medical equipment, including for both the hospitals’ emergency departments. These include close to 4,000 medical and supporting equipment such as BP monitors, ECG and cardiac machines, oxygen flow meters, defibrillators, ventilators, oxygen concentrators, critical care vital monitors and ICU beds. Recognising the need to reduce burnout and mental health challenges among frontline health workers, the programme will also provide mental health and psychosocial support services through reliable health management modules and mechanisms, and deliver direct aid to reduce the livelihood burdens of these workers and their family members. Zamzamzairani said Maybank’s contribution would also see the setting up of a temporary field hospital at HTAR together with the provision of technical training to the staff to augment the treatment and recovery of Covid-19 patients. This will help reduce the existing load at the ICU and general wards by the active management of Category 3 patients, he said. “Our hope is that by working together with the health authorities, Mercy Malaysia and all Malaysians, the sustainability of our nation’s healthcare system will be assured, and our hospitals will be better equipped and prepared to face not only the current Covid-19 outbreak, but also future pandemics,” he added.

"Hussein: Phase Two will not make much difference to eateries, as dine-in is still prohibited. JOHOR government has been urged to ramp up its vaccination efforts before moving to Phase Two of the National Recovery Plan (NRP). A Johorean, Ariff Mohammad Nizam, 29, said speeding up vaccination and conducting mass Covid-19 testing should be the main focus now. “With the current number of Covid-19 cases in the state, it is likely to slip back to Phase One. “The state government should instead focus on ramping up the vaccination process, which has also been highlighted by the Johor royal family several times. “It should also start mass testing, especially at red zones and industrial areas,” said the corporate communication executive. Ariff Mohammad added that the state should also ensure that the Health Department was prepared, including in terms of facilities, to face the risk of Covid-19 cases increasing once Johor moves to Phase Two of the NRP. Online business owner Lee Wee Ping, 37, said that while he looked forward to the standard operating procedure (SOP) being relaxed, it was still too early for Johor to transition into Phase Two. “I hope for the SOP to be relaxed as I know many people are suffering due to the restrictions. “My business has been badly affected since the implementation of the NRP Phase One in June. “However, after looking at the number of cases over the past few days, I think we should wait a while more before moving into the next phase,” he said. Lee also hopes that the government would use more mobile vaccine dispensing centres (PPV) to speed up the process of vaccination in Johor. Johor Indian Muslim Entrepre-neur Association (Perusim) secretary Hussein Ibrahim said moving into Phase Two would not make much difference to most businesses here, especially eateries. “Restaurants will still not be allowed to have dine-in customers. “Non-essential businesses that are allowed to operate may not see many customers either as they may be afraid to go out when the daily number of Covid-19 cases remains high. “For me, it is better for Johor to move into Phase Two only when the number of cases remains low for at least a week,” he said, adding that ramping up vaccination should be the main priority. On July 7, Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad said the state was expected to move into Phase Two of the NRP this week as it had met several criteria set by the Federal Government. Other states that have moved to Phase Two are Perlis, Perak, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang and Penang. LAW graduates have many career options.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts VAN HORN, Texas (Reuters) -Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, is set on Tuesday to blast off aboard his company Blue Origin's New Shepard https://graphics.reuters.com/SPACE-EXPLORATION/BLUEORIGIN/jbyprzzympe/blue-origin.jpg launch vehicle for a suborbital flight as part of a history-making crew - another milestone in ushering in a new era of private space travel. The American billionaire is due to fly from a desert site in West Texas on an 11-minute voyage to the edge of space, nine days after Briton Richard Branson was aboard his competing space tourism company Virgin Galactic's successful inaugural suborbital flight https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/virgin-galactics-branson-ready-space-launch-aboard-rocket-plane-2021-07-11 from New Mexico.  Branson got to space first, but Bezos is due to fly higher - 62 miles (100 km) for Blue Origin compared to 53 miles (86 km) for Virgin Galactic - in what experts call the world's first https://www.blueorigin.com/news-archive/first-human-flight-updates unpiloted space flight with an all-civilian crew.  Bezos, founder of ecommerce juggernaut Amazon.com Inc, and his brother and private equity executive Mark Bezos will be joined in the flight by two others. Pioneering female aviator Wally Funk https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/trailblazing-female-pilot-will-go-space-age-82-with-jeff-bezos-2021-07-01, 82, and recent high school graduate Oliver Daemen https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-blueorigin/teenager-to-fly-with-bezos-in-inaugural-space-tourism-flight-idUSKBN2EL1ZJ?feedType=RSS&feedName=technologyNews, 18, are set to become the oldest and youngest people to reach space.  ""I am excited, but not anxious. We'll see how I feel when I'm strapped into my seat,"" Bezos said in an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday. ""... We're ready. The vehicle's ready. This team is amazing. I feel very good about it. And I think my fellow crewmates feel good about it, too."" Funk was one of the so-called Mercury 13 group of women who trained to become NASA astronauts in the early 1960s but was passed over because of her gender.  Daemen, Blue Origin's first paying customer, is set to attend the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands to study physics and innovation management in September. His father heads investment management firm Somerset Capital Partners. Barring technical or weather-related delays, New Shepard is due to blast off around 8 a.m. CDT (1300 GMT) from Blue Origin's Launch Site One facility about 20 miles (32 km) outside the rural Texas town of Van Horn. New Shepard is a 60-foot-tall (18.3-meters-tall) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo that cannot be piloted from inside the spacecraft. It is completely computer-flown and will have none of Blue Origin's staff astronauts https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/bezos-blue-origin-make-history-with-unpiloted-civilian-space-flight-2021-07-14 or trained personnel onboard.  In contrast, Virgin Galactic used a space plane with a pair of pilots onboard.  New Shepard will hurtle at speeds upwards of 2,200 miles (3,540 km) per hour to an altitude of about 62 miles (100 km), the so-called Kármán line set by an international aeronautics body as defining the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space.  During the flight, the crew will unbuckle for a few minutes of weightlessness and gaze back at the Earth's curvature through what Blue Origin calls the largest windows ever used in space travel. Then, the capsule falls back to Earth under parachutes, using a last-minute retro-thrust system that expels a ""pillow of air"" for a soft landing at 1 mph (1.6 km/h) in the Texas desert.  The reusable booster is due to return to the launch pad using drag brakes and ring and wedge fins for stabilization.  Tuesday's launch marks another landmark in the ""billionaire's race"" to establish a space tourism sector that Swiss investment bank UBS estimates will reach $3 billion annually in a decade. Another billionaire tech mogul, Elon Musk, plans to send an all-civilian crew on an even more ambitious flight in September: a several-day orbital mission on his Crew Dragon capsule. On Twitter, Musk  wished https://bit.ly/2TqOL9I the Blue Origin crew ""best of luck"" for the launch.  Blue Origin has not offered details on its longer-term pricing strategy or how quickly it will ramp up the frequency of its launches. Chief Executive Bob Smith has said the next flight is likely in September or October. Smith said the ""willingness to pay continues to be quite high"" for people interested in future flights.  The company appears to have a reservoir of future customers. More than 6,000 people from at least 143 countries entered an auction to become the first paying customer, though the auction winner who made a $28 million bid ultimately dropped out of Tuesday's flight. Bezos, who founded Blue Origin in 2000, has a net worth of $206 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires.

"Salim and his wife Leiti attaching ropes to plastic drums, which will be dropped into the sea to cultivate mussels. — Photos: THOMAS YONG/The Star SLOW business at seafood restaurants around the district has affected the income of some 80 Orang Asli Seletar families in Kampung Sungai Temon in Johor Baru. Its Tok Batin (village chief) Salim Palon said that most of the 400 people in the village worked as fishermen and supplied to restaurants in the city. Although restaurants are allowed to open during Phase One of the National Recovery Plan, many have opted to close due to lack of customers. “Prior to the pandemic, the majority of seafood restaurants in Johor Baru depended on Singaporean customers who are now unable to come due to the closure of the border,” he said when met at the village near Skudai. Salim, who is also a fisherman and owns a seafood restaurant in the village, said that he too had opted to stop operating since March last year. “I will end up having to spend more money if I continue, as there are hardly any customers. “I am focusing on supplying mussels as there is high demand among locals,” he said. Meanwhile, fisherman Mat Akel Mood, 38, said he used to supply seafood to four restaurants in Johor Baru which have either stopped operating temporarily or reduced their orders. “I supply crabs, mussels and fish to restaurants around town but there is less demand for seafood now. “While there are other customers, they are offering a price that is too low for us to make a living. “They are willing to buy 1kg of crab for RM8, which is not enough to even cover our petrol costs,” he said. Mat Akel said the price of crabs, which were previously sold to seafood restaurants for about RM25 per kg, had gone down to RM22 per kg. “Only mussels are selling well but we can only harvest them once every six months. “Most of the seafood we catch now is for our own consumption,” he added. Fisherman Leiti Akon, 59, said that a sack with about 56kg of mussels could be sold for about RM150. “We are providing mussels to buyers from not only Johor but also other states such as Melaka and Penang. “However, due to pollution, it is becoming more difficult for us to harvest mature mussels. “Other sea products are also depleting due to pollution, and we have to go farther to get a decent catch,” she added.

"FILE PHOTO: Austrian lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems sits in his office ahead of a Reuters interview in Vienna, Austria, July 16, 2020. REUTERS/Lisi Niesner/File Photo BERLIN (Reuters) -Austria's Supreme Court has questioned the legal basis on which Facebook collects user data and referred key issues for a ruling by Europe's top court, after awarding symbolic damages to activist Max Schrems in his privacy case against the company. In a 34-page ruling, the Austrian court accepted the request from Schrems, who has waged a years-long campaign against what he views as Facebook's intrusive privacy practices, to refer key questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union.     The civil case revolves around Schrems' assertion that Facebook deprives users of the rights and protections they enjoy under the EU's privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), by treating consent as a contract that empowers it to use their data to deliver targeted ads. ""Facebook tries to strip users of many GDPR rights by simply 'reinterpreting' consent to be a civil law contract,"" Schrems said in a statement on Tuesday. ""This was nothing but a cheap attempt to bypass the GDPR."" Facebook said it had received the court judgment and was reviewing its contents. ""We are committed to the principles of GDPR and have made major changes to our business as part of our ongoing efforts to give users meaningful transparency and control over their data,” a Facebook spokesperson said. One question referred by the Austrian court asks whether Facebook's declaration that it intends to process user data undermines the significantly higher protection that consent offers under the GDPR. Further questions relate to whether Facebook's collection of data from 'Like' buttons and other online sources respects the GDPR's principle of data minimisation - in other words that it should not collect more user data than is necessary. The Austrian court also awarded Schrems 500 euros ($589) in symbolic damages over Facebook's obstructive tactics in response to his request to share the data it holds on him. ""The plaintiff rightfully points out that the GDPR is based on a one-time request for access, not on an 'Easter egg hunt',"" the court wrote in its ruling.

"As Tokyo again prepares to host the Games this week, Japan is in a technological funk. Its heyday of setting the pace in televisions, recording devices and computers is far behind it. — Reuters When Tokyo last hosted the Olympics, in 1964, the unveiling of a bullet train capable of the improbable speed of 210 kilometers an hour (130 mph) heralded the dawn of a high-tech era in Japan. Within a decade and a half, innovations such as Sony Corp’s videocassette recorder, Toshiba Corp flash memory and  , the arcade shoot-em up that revolutionised the gaming industry, made Japan synonymous with global technological superiority, and the talk was of it overtaking the US as the world’s biggest economy. As Tokyo again prepares to host the Games this week, Japan is in a technological funk. Its heyday of setting the pace in televisions, recording devices and computers is far behind it. While Japan can claim credit for the Walkman, Apple Inc came up with the iPhone. More humiliating yet, regional rival South Korea and its tech giant Samsung Electronics Co have overtaken Japan in smartphones and memory chips. That’s not simply a blow to Japanese national pride; it’s a corporate dilemma and an economic liability just as a fourth wave of Covid-19 robs the country of Olympic spectators and the revenue they’d bring to help spur a rebound from the pandemic. In an increasingly polarised world where the US and China are setting technology and data standards, Japan runs the risk of being left further behind. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is fighting back, with plans to bolster the computer chip industry elevated to a national project on a par with securing food or energy. But executives and government officials in the industry say the solution will also require something else: A fundamental shift in the way Japan has conducted business for decades. That means reducing red tape, recruiting foreign chipmaking talent and completely dropping “a stubborn insistence on Japan-centricism”, said Kazumi Nishikawa, a director at the IT division of the all-encompassing Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade, known as METI. “This made-in-Japan self-reliance approach didn’t work out,” he said. “We want to avoid that this time around.” Japan may have taken a big step in that direction by enticing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to help rebuild its once dominant chip industry. Last week, chief executive officer C.C. Wei surprised observers when he said that TSMC was doing “due diligence” on a wafer fab, appearing to confirm long-running speculation over plans by the world’s leading advanced chipmaker to build a facility in Japan. Japan, the world’s No. 3 economy after the US and China, is budgeting for hundreds of billions of yen to plough into chips, but it’s a drop in the ocean compared to the kind of money being waved about in the US, where at least US$52 billion (5.7 trillion yen) is being made available to support domestic semiconductor production. In South Korea, companies like Samsung and SK Hynix are pledging US$450 billion over a decade, while TSMC alone is earmarking US$100 billion over the next three years. “Some countries are offering support on a different order of magnitude,” making it hard to compete, said Akira Amari, tax chief of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and a former minister of state for economic and fiscal policy. Still, he said, the prime minister is “extremely good” at getting things done and is now focused on digitalization and carbon neutrality, two issues linked by semiconductors. Japan still boasts pockets of excellence in fields including robotics and supercomputing, while Japanese engineers have just shattered the world record for the fastest Internet speed, according to a report last week on interestingengineering.com. In the White House supply chain review published in June, Japan is mentioned 85 times, just ahead of Taiwan and South Korea, and the same number of references as Europe. Tetsuro Higashi, chairman emeritus at semiconductor equipment maker Tokyo Electron Ltd, said the task of addressing Japan’s decline is not as straightforward as rebuilding one industry. He cited Japan’s semiconductor strengths as Kioxia for memory and Sony’s image sensors, along with component and power-chip makers and chip manufacturing equipment, saying “the strategy has to connect those pieces and form a core”. “There is a more fundamental sense of crisis,” Higashi, who heads an expert panel advising the government on its chip strategy, said in an interview. “The fear is that if this goes bad, the whole Japanese economy will suffer.” Like all the world’s most advanced nations, Japan’s technological shortcomings were exposed by the pandemic. Its recognition in Washington belies a decline in technological influence for a variety of reasons, political, economic and cultural. Take semiconductors, the present government focus: In 1990, Japan held some 50% of the global chip market; now it’s 6%, according to IC Insights. An analysis of scientific papers submitted to the main semiconductor conferences conducted by the Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung shows a precipitous decline in Japanese contributions over the past 25 years, to the extent that China overtook it last year. “Diminishing market shares seem to go hand-in-hand with decreasing R&D power,” SNV researchers Jan-Peter Kleinhans and Julia Hess write in their report, “Who is developing the chips of the future?” In a devastating presentation to the lower house Science and Technology Committee last month, independent consultant Takashi Yunogami laid bare Japan’s failings. Japan used to manufacture memory for mainframe computers, where clients demanded high quality and a 25-year guarantee. But come the rise of personal computers, Japanese industry failed to respond, leaving Samsung to offer PC memory with a three-year guarantee at a fraction of the cost. In an increasingly disposable digital age, Japan suffered a “high quality disease”. The industry’s troubles were compounded by a government response that favoured the creation of domestic champions over foreign collaboration. In 1999, Tokyo encouraged the merger of Hitachi and NEC’s memory businesses under the name Elpida, the Greek for “hope”. In 2012 it filed for bankruptcy with liabilities of US$5.5 billion, a victim of plunging prices. It was bought by Micron Technologies of the US. “All sorts of things were tried to stop the downward trend – national projects, consortiums, joint ventures – all failed,” Yunogami told lawmakers. “The chip industry is beyond recovery.” Like the other officials, however, he saw a ray of hope in terms of Japan’s share of the global market for chip equipment and raw materials, which translates into thousands of small companies making things like wafers and specialised liquids. The government’s best chance is to focus on those few successes and “make the strong stronger”, he said. Government intervention in the chip industry helped build its dominance in the first place. Yet talk of government help today is poison to some in business, illustrating Suga’s difficulties in securing the support for a technological revival. There’s another reason Japanese officials cite for the country’s relative decline that would sound familiar to Chinese observers: a trade war with the US. Some 40 years ago, spooked by Japan’s rise, the US imposed a requirement to use a certain percentage of US chips or face trade tariffs. “America saw Japan’s emergence as a threat and pushed back,” said Amari, the ruling party’s tax chief. Yet Japan’s industry was also guilty of complacency, content to focus on the domestic market without venturing out into the world, he said, citing the downfall of Docomo, the first company to connect mobile phones to the Internet. It lost out to Samsung and Apple. Today, the national security issues related to technology mean the government faces “the kind of change that happens once in a hundred years”. That means it must embrace the challenge or fall behind, he said. “Japan is good at taking things from zero to one, and not so much at taking them from one to 10,” he said. “Japan wins in technology and loses in business.” – Bloomberg LAW graduates have many career options.

"Fong (third from left)  with Elaine (third from right) at the  handover  of aid for  families in Bukit Bintang. SOME 70 disadvantaged households each in the Bukit Bintang and Cheras parliamentary constituencies will receive food aid from the Rotary Club of Pudu. Its president Elaine Tan said the club embarked on the initiative in view of the rising number of poor in the city because of economic uncertainties. She said the club was working closely with several elected representatives, who would be better at identifying deserving recipients in their respective constituencies. “These first 140 boxes today are part of the 300 we have prepared for the constituencies. “We hope the aid can lighten the burden of those financially affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said when met in Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur. Elaine added that the club had organised a similar contribution for the Lembah Pantai parliamentary and Lembah Jaya state constituencies. Bukit Bintang MP Fong Kui Lun, who was present, thanked the club for the contribution and pledged to distribute the boxes soon. He said his parliamentary office had been working to identify needy families, especially those in low-cost flats. “We will distribute the boxes that we get from the club to some residents at the Hang Tuah Public Housing (PA). “We will get in touch with the residents association there to get a list of deserving recipients,” he said. At another event, Cheras MP Tan Kok Wai said the aid was timely and would be distributed soon. He estimated that there were some 6,000 low-cost flats units in the constituency, with the bulk of them being people’s housing projects (PPR) and PA. “There are also several old folks homes and orphanages operating here. “They are facing financial hardship due to fewer donors and volunteers these days,” he added. Kok Wai pledged to provide aid to anyone who needed it. He said his office would get the list of qualified recipients from the local community leaders. Also present at both events was the club’s honorary secretary Mike Tung. — By FARID WAHAB LAW graduates have many career options.

"Beneath certain videos about health, YouTube will add information panels that will alert viewers if the source is ‘authoritative’, such as when the video comes from an accredited hospital. YouTube will also start displaying select videos more prominently on the site when people search for health terms, similar to how it now treats certain news topics. — Reuters YouTube will start labelling health videos with information on how authoritative the source is just days after US President Joe Biden tore into social media for “killing people” by spreading falsehoods about vaccines. YouTube, part of Alphabet Inc’s Google, announced the changes on Monday. Beneath certain videos about health, the company will add information panels that will alert viewers if the source is “authoritative”, such as when the video comes from an accredited hospital. YouTube will also start displaying select videos more prominently on the site when people search for health terms, similar to how it now treats certain news topics. For both the material in these panels and its ranking system, YouTube said it will rely on a recent set of guidelines for verifying online information from the US National Academy of Medicine, a non-governmental organisation. “These principles for health sources are the first of its kind,” Garth Graham, director of health care for YouTube, wrote in a blog post. “We hope that other companies will also review and consider how these principles might help inform their work with their own products and platforms.” Graham, a former health insurance executive, was hired by YouTube at the start of the year to lead a new effort to highlight and produce these videos. Like social networks Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc, YouTube has worked to better moderate its flood of user-generated media to deal with misinformation on Covid-19 and vaccines. The platform has removed thousands of videos for violating its misinformation rules since the pandemic began, which has led to criticism for being too censorious, particularly from the political right. Yet the Biden Administration has gone on an offensive against technology companies in its push for more Americans to get vaccinated and the surgeon general released a report on health misinformation. And on Friday, Biden criticised social networks for their role in letting anti-vaccination material spread. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said Sunday that misinformation on social media about vaccines adds urgency to her call to change liability standards for what is published on their platforms. “YouTube removes content in accordance with our Covid-19 misinformation policies,” the company said. “We also demote borderline videos and prominently surface authoritative content for Covid-19-related search results, recommendations, and context panels.” The company said it will continue working with health organisations and other medical experts to prevent the spread of misinformation. Three years ago, YouTube started adding fact-check labels beneath videos that dealt with popular conspiracy theories, like those about the moon landing or linking vaccines to autism. Twitter also said it would do its part to “elevate authoritative health information”, while Facebook expanded on its defense over the weekend with a blog on how it can’t take the blame for missed target for US vaccinations. “At a time when Covid-19 cases are rising in America, the Biden administration has chosen to blame a handful of American social media companies,” Facebook’s Vice President of Integrity Guy Rosen said in the post. “Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed.” On Monday, Biden walked back his accusation that Facebook was “killing people” with misinformation, pinning the problem instead on a group of anti-vaccine agitators active on social media. YouTube has also argued that it doesn’t operate the same way as social networks, since it doesn’t have the same sort of viral sharing. But its algorithm does feed people a majority of the videos watched on the site. The surgeon general’s report didn’t mention YouTube by name, but it cited a recent academic study that examined vaccine information on YouTube. Since late 2019, pro-vaccine videos show up higher in YouTube’s search rankings, according to the research. But once viewers watch an anti-vaccine video, YouTube’s system ends up exposing them to more of the same, it added. A YouTube spokesperson said the company has been working on these recent changes since February. They are coming to viewers in the US first, and the company is planning to add more countries. – Bloomberg MUCH has been said about the availability of jobs during these challenging times.

WHILE Balik Pulau MP Muhammad Bakhtiar Wan Chik was preparing to distribute food baskets using his RM300,000 parliamentary allocation, a group came forward to give 350 food baskets to the people of Balik Pulau. Muhammad Bakhtiar said the food baskets worth RM100 each were given by a pastor and his friends who had raised the funds. “Each food basket contained 5kg rice, fresh chicken, eggs, sugar, flour, drinks and canned food. “They were distributed to 350 households in Bayan Lepas, Teluk Bahang and Pulau Betong by Village Community Management Council (MPKK) members. “The list of people getting the aid was given by MPKK members and once all the food baskets under the government programme arrive, we will be distributing them to others in the three constituencies,” he added. Pastor Yeoh Yong Chong and his friends Sister Evon Ooi and Datin Karen Ng were the three individuals instrumental in raising funds for the food baskets. “We were disturbed by a recent suicide case caused by the pandemic and gathered to raise funds for the poor,” said Yeoh. “Many responded to our call and we have raised RM51,000 so far which was used for the distribution in Balik Pulau,” he said. Yeoh added there would be another round of food basket distribution to 300 families in Jelutong soon. MUCH has been said about the availability of jobs during these challenging times.

"American researchers are working on giving artificial intelligence the same capacity for imagination as humans. — AFP Relaxnews While machines outperform man in many fields, they lag behind when it comes to being creative. Or it takes a lot of training. The French collective Obvious, for example, previously “fed” an algorithm with more than 15,000 portraits dating from the Middle Ages to the 20th century to enable the program to create a portrait titled  . And this long-term effort paid off, it seems, as the painting sold for US$432,500 (RM1.82mil) at Christie’s, 45 times its estimated price. Now, researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) are working hard to endow artificial intelligence with the very “human” quality of imagination. They have recently developed an algorithm capable of designing novel objects with different attributes. “We were inspired by human visual generalisation capabilities to try to simulate human imagination in machines,” explains Yunhao Ge, a PhD student on the USC research team. “Humans can separate their learned knowledge by attributes – for instance, shape, pose, position, colour – and then recombine them to imagine a new object. Our paper attempts to simulate this process using neural networks.” The scientists used the concept of “disentanglement” to allow the machine to generate new images from numerous visual samples. The artificial intelligence program uses the features it has observed in the various images analysed to perform a “controllable novel image synthesis”. This process of extrapolation could be the next best thing to what we might consider imagination, and has allowed the researchers to generate a database containing 1.56 million novel images. “Disentanglement” already allows algorithms to make deepfakes, the controversial videos where one face is replaced by another. But this technique could help machines go even further, according to Laurent Itti, professor of computer science at USC. In fact, it could make it easier to synthesise new drugs, or to avoid reproducing the racist and sexist stereotypes recently highlighted in artificial intelligence programs. “Deep learning has already demonstrated unsurpassed performance and promise in many domains, but all too often this has happened through shallow mimicry, and without a deeper understanding of the separate attributes that make each object unique,” said Laurent Itti. “This new disentanglement approach, for the first time, truly unleashes a new sense of imagination in AI systems, bringing them closer to humans’ understanding of the world.” – AFP Relaxnews MUCH has been said about the availability of jobs during these challenging times.

"Jagdeep looking on as a man is given a swab test for Covid-19 during mass testing held at Flat Hamna in Batu Uban, Penang. LESS than 0.5% of Penangites who volunteered for the Covid-19 mass testing under the Penang Saringan Covid-19 (PSC-19) were found positive. State local government committee chairman Jagdeep Singh Deo said out of 4,718 participants as of Sunday, only 23 of them were found to be Covid-19 positive after confirmation through their subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. A total of 6,135 people had registered for PSC-19 as of Sunday. Jagdeep, who visited the PSC-19 venue at Dewan MPKK Sungai Dua, neat Flat Hamna, Batu Uban, said the Pengkalan Kota constituency recorded the highest number of registrations totalling 1,366, followed by Mak Mandin Hijau Flats with 1,068 people. The programme will continue at five more locations from July 23 to 25. PSC-19 is the mass testing of Penangites using rapid antigen test kits. Those tested positive will be notified to self-isolate and be given a date to do the more accurate PCR test. Jagdeep urged more people to register for vaccination as at least 1.4 million in Penang people need to be vaccinated. Batu Uban assemblyman A. Kumaresan thanked the state government as the area was a hotspot with numerous cases recently. “There are many residents here and most of them work in the construction sector and as hawkers,” he said. Meanwhile, Penang Hill Corporation (PHC) said in a statement that five of its hill maintenance workers tested positive via rapid antigen tests after coming in close contact with a former worker. After tests done on Saturday turned out positive, they were isolated and the Health Ministry was informed, said PHC.

"Ahead of the Olympic Games, Withings studied data from its community of smart device users to award its own gold, silver and bronze medals. — Cartoon vector created by vectorjuice - www.freepik.com The Tokyo Olympic Games start this Friday, July 23. For the occasion, Withings has collated data from five million user profiles from 20 different countries to draw up its own list of medal winners in events as diverse as sleep quality, time spent training, number of steps per day, and muscle mass gained. So which counties are the Withings champions? And how will the Withings medal haul compare to Olympic performances? Good sleep hygiene is essential for prime performance, so which country takes the top spot in the Withings study? When it comes to the National Sleep Score rankings, Finland takes the gold medal! The Netherlands takes second place, followed by Belgium in third. The lowest scorers in the sleep ranking are Russia, China and Japan. A surprising result, perhaps, as Russia and China are regularly among the countries taking home the most medals in the Summer Olympics. According to the WHO, people need to take the equivalent of 10,000 steps a day to stay fit, maintain health and control weight. So which country does best when it comes to number of steps per day? Here, Spain takes the gold, with an average of 6,527 steps per day per person, ahead of Sweden (6,469) and China (6,228). At the bottom of the ranking, Belgium (5,364) comes in 18th position, ahead of France (5,352) and Hungary (5,351). But in terms of the number of hours spent swimming, France wins by a considerable margin with 829,555 hours of training in the pool. Next comes another world specialist, the United States (504,544 hours), followed by Germany (461,951 hours). Poland, Norway and Hungary take the last positions in this ranking. Finally, which country gained the most muscle mass during workouts? In this particular event, the Latin countries win by a wide margin, with Spain (+320 grams), Italy (+283 grams) and France (+272 grams) on the podium in that order. Japan comes in last place, with a decrease of 705 grams in muscle mass in average over the last four years. More surprisingly, Australia is 19th behind China and the United States. So while these statistics don’t necessarily give much away about national performances in the Olympics, they do tell us more about the sports habits of smart device users around the world.

"TOURISM Selangor marked its 20th anniversary with a virtual celebration. Present at the event held during “Tourism Selangor’s LiveTalk – Episode 2” on its official Facebook page were Tourism Selangor general manager Azrul Shah Mohamad as well as Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry (Selangor division) director Syed Mohd Fariz Syed Mansor Al Idrus. The celebration was more than merely making memories; it also reflected Tourism Selangor’s roles, responsibilities and accomplishments throughout the years. During the LiveTalk session, an exclusive clip featuring Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari was shared with the audience. Tourism Selangor was incorporated under the Companies Act 1965, and was registered as a private company on Feb 24, 1994. It was a subsidiary of Permodalan Nasional Selangor Bhd (PNSB) until 2008 before the ownership was transferred to Menteri Besar Selangor (Inc) (MBI). “Throughout these two decades, the agency’s initiatives in constantly discovering new tourism places as well as promoting interesting tourism attractions such as cultural diversity has brought success to the state,” said Amirudin. “In 2019, Selangor attracted a staggering 30 million tourists, which certainly had a positive impact on the state’s economy, particularly its tourism industry. “However, in bracing the impact, Selangor’s comprehensive economic plans, such as Kita Selangor Package 1 and Kita Selangor Package 2.0, have included financial aid for the tourism industry. “So in conjunction with Tourism Selangor’s 20th anniversary, let us all stay resilient in overcoming obstacles and challenges to become a preferred and premier tourism destination, both domestically and globally,” he added. Selangor tourism, environment, green technology and Orang Asli affairs committee chairman Hee Loy Sian, in a statement, said that for two decades, the agency had been largely instrumental in promoting tourism in the state. “I hope Tourism Selangor will become the backbone of tourism industry players in the state and will pay attention to their needs and concerns from time to time,” he added. Leading Tourism Selangor since January last year, Azrul Shah said it was not easy to reach this benchmark in 20 years. “Certainly, those associated with the agency, both in the past and present, have overcome many challenges and obstacles and have bittersweet memories along the way. “I am taking this opportunity to express my appreciation to every one who has supported us in the past two decades. “They include the media that has always highlighted our promotional initiatives, government and private agencies that have supported Tourism Selangor’s events and programmes over the years, as well as the public,” he added. Tourism Selangor product and package development executive Zolkafli Abdul, who has been with the agency for 20 years, said he was grateful for the opportunity to work as a supervisor at Chongkak Park and Resort. “It gave me the experience of managing a large area which required thorough supervision,” he shared. Meanwhile, Tourism Selangor promotion manager Khuzaimah Jamaluddin, who has been with Tourism Selangor for almost 13 years, said: “Tourism Selangor will always be close to my heart and I hope it will continue to be a well-established organisation responsible for boosting tourism in the state.” Emphasising on integrity and dedication in continuing its sterling track record in the decades to come, Tourism Selangor has implemented various promotional initiatives, including its domestic tourism campaign “Pusing Selangor Dulu” (literally, it means Rounding Selangor First) aimed at rebuilding the industry post-pandemic. Other initiatives include executing physical and virtual tourism initiatives in compliance with Covid-19 standard operating procedure, strengthening the digital platform geared towards “Tourism 4.0”, holding round-table discussions with government and private agencies as well as industry players, and strengthening advertising campaigns across all platforms.

Shawn Thew/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told regulators Monday that the U.S. government must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a rapidly growing class of digital currencies. A group of U.S. regulators plans to issue recommendations in the coming months for fixing any regulatory gaps around stablecoins, the Treasury Department said in a statement. Monday's meeting of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which convenes top financial watchdogs, underscores how quickly policymakers are moving to ensure their rules can keep up with rapid technological changes across digital currencies. The group discussed the rapid growth of stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies that attempt to peg their values to a conventional currency, like the U.S. dollar, according to the Treasury. Regulators discussed their potential uses, as well as risks to end users and the financial system. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers during congressional hearings last week that stablecoins are ""growing incredibly fast"" but pointed to their lack of appropriate regulation as a point of concern.

"(From left) Tiew Kiong, Sacred Heart School principal David Teo, Senator Lau, Yong and Chan at the mock cheque 
presentation ceremony. Former students of Sacred Heart School in Sibu, Sarawak, known as “Knights”, came to the aid of their alma mater by raising RM88,000. Anthony Chan, who spearheaded the project for the school’s underprivileged students, said the amount far exceeded what he had expected. Speaking at a mock cheque presentation ceremony, the class of 1993 member said although the initial target had been RM6,100, members the Old Students Association (Shosa) were confident more would be raised. “They told me to go forward with courage and set a target of RM12,200 instead, assuring me that SH Knights would rally to the cause,” he added. The donation drive was launched on July 12, with the association’s former president Dr Gregory Hii being the first to contribute. To Chan’s surprise, the momentum kept growing and when the donation drive ended, former Shosa president Senator Robert Lau came forward to round up the figure to RM88,000. A visibly moved Chan thanked all his seniors, peers and juniors who gave so generously towards the cause. “I feel very proud to be among this league of extraordinary gentlemen who returned to the school to help current students,” he said. School senior assistant and the fundraising drive’s co-chairman Lau Tiew Kiong said the funds would be distributed in four phases. He said phase one was for a batch of 49 students while the second phase would benefit 75 pupils of Sacred Heart English Primary School. “The third phase will be after school resumes, whereby funds will be extended to other underprivileged secondary school students.” The final phase would be a “targeted assistance” exercise, where needy students would get aid in cash and kind, said Tiew Kiong. Shosa president Yong King Sung said the Knights could always be counted upon to lend their alma mater a helping hand. “Last October, the Knights chipped in more than RM120,000 to help upgrade the sound system in the school hall and two lecture halls. “And now they have stepped up again, united in the fight against poverty.” Yong added that while older former students responded well to this latest initiative, it was a great sense of relief to see that so many of the younger ones came forward too. Senator Lau, who was present at the event, also helped family members of aid recipients to register for the Covid 19 vaccination. — By ANDY CHUA MUCH has been said about the availability of jobs during these challenging times.

The company's shares were up 2% at $140.73 in extended trading. ""With the reopening (of economies) in particular around North America and Western Europe, we're seeing a nice rebound in travel and transportation, automotive, industrial and consumer sectors overall,"" IBM Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters, adding that more clients spent on digitizing their operations. After the pandemic battered existing models of business, more enterprises are adopting ""hybrid cloud"", a combination of using their own data centers and leased computing resources to manage and process data. Sales at IBM's cloud business rose 13% to $7 billion in the reported quarter. Seeing a $1 trillion market opportunity in ""hybrid-cloud"", IBM has been investing aggressively in cloud and artificial intelligence-focused ventures, while also shedding its slow-growing, yet huge, managed infrastructure business. Since the beginning of the year, the company has spent about $3 billion on eight acquisitions, Kavanaugh said. IBM's net income fell to $1.33 billion, or $1.47 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $1.36 billion, or $1.52 per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 3% to $18.75 billion, beating estimates of $18.29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

"KIWANIS Malaysia has launched a crowdfunding platform for families in dire need of assistance as their livelihoods continue to be affected by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Called the Kiwanis White Flag Community Fund, the initiative is aimed at helping families in “hotspots” in numerous districts throughout the country, such as Klang. Initiated by Kiwanis Klang Club (Kiwanis Klang), the other chapters in the country will follow suit to help disburse food boxes or vouchers from 99 Speedmart stores to affected families. For now, Kiwanis Klang will provide 99 Speedmart vouchers ranging from RM50 to RM200 for the purchase of essential items, enabling every recipient to buy items themselves which will help reduce wastage in the process. Those targeted are B40 families located in the Klang area, many of whom have suffered loss of employment and income under current trying times. The coupons and donation boxes will be distributed by Kiwanis and its partners kEATchen and Lalamove. In appealing to the public for donations, the organisation said some of the money raised through the crowdfunding would be used to support food bank initiatives by kEATchen, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Based in Petaling Jaya, the NGO has started a food bank where anyone within a 10km radius in need of food will be able to receive a box. Lalamove, via its “Deliver Care” delivery sponsorship, will help Kiwanis to make deliveries to collection points or to the homes of individuals and families. All Malaysians are urged to contribute towards the fund as the NGO aims to reach out to as many families in need of assistance as possible. The Kiwanis Giving Portal has thus been set up, where donors can select and support any of the clubs’ White Flag Community Fund campaigns. A round-table discussion via Zoom was also held recently, where topics ranging from tackling aid distribution, nutritional needs of families and the looming mental health crisis were deliberated by a panel.

"U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the economy at the White House in Washington, U.S. July 19, 2021.  REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden took a softer tone when talking about Facebook Inc on Monday, after saying last week that the social media company was ""killing people"" by allowing the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Biden told reporters on Monday he meant to accuse a dozen users who spread the most amount of misinformation on the social media platform, but not the company itself. ""Facebook isn’t killing people,"" he said. ""These 12 people are out there giving misinformation. Anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It's killing people. It's bad information."" He also said he hopes that Facebook does more to stop the spread of misinformation. White House press secretary Jen Psaki also tried to clarify Biden's remarks. ""We are not in a war or a battle with Facebook, we're in a battle with the virus,"" she said. COVID-19 misinformation has spread during the pandemic on social media sites including Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet-owned YouTube. Researchers and lawmakers have long accused Facebook of failing to police harmful content on its platforms. When asked on Friday about his message to Facebook and other social media platforms, Biden responded: ""They're killing people. ... Look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they're killing people."" Facebook responded sharply last week, saying that 85% of its users were vaccinated or wanted to be. ""President Biden’s goal was for 70% of Americans to be vaccinated by July 4. Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed,"" Facebook said in a corporate blog post by Guy Rosen, a company vice president. The company has introduced rules against making specific false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines to prevent the illness, and says it provides people with reliable information on these topics.

"Selling flavoured lemang has become a source of livelihood for Hanafiah and Nor Adila during these challenging times. — Bernama FOR carpenter Hanafiah Mohd Noor, 38, and his wife Nor Adila Ramli, 30, selling flavoured lemang has become their source of livelihood during the Covid-19 pandemic. Hanafiah and Nor Adila started their ‘Lemang Guling Bakar Original 100 Peratus’ business after Hanafiah was out of work due to the pandemic. “Since I cannot continue building houses, I use the lemang-making skills I learned while living in Pasir Gudang, Johor, during this difficult time. “Many people are used to eating lemang wrapped in lerek or banana leaves but lemang jagung (corn) and lemang pulut hitam (black glutinous rice) are quite different,” he said when met at Kampung Lepan Kandis, Pulai Chondong in Machang, Kelantan, recently. The couple sell lemang only on Thursdays at a price of between RM8 and RM14 a stick (original flavour) and between RM10 and RM14 a stick for lemang jagung and pulut hitam.

"FILE PHOTO: Mural displaying Jeff Bezo and his brother Mark Bezo, is seen in Van Horn, Texas, two days before the scheduled launch of Blue Origin's inaugural flight to the edge of space by billionaire American businessman Jeff Bezos and his three crewmates, in the nearby town of Van Horn, Texas, U.S. July 18, 2021.   REUTERS/Thom Baur/File Photo (Reuters) -     American billionaire businessman Jeff Bezos said on Monday he is excited and curious but not very nervous on the eve of taking part in his company Blue Origin's inaugural suborbital flight alongside the oldest and youngest people ever bound for space. The world's richest person and three crewmates are due to fly from a desert site in West Texas on an 11-minute trip to the edge of space aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard, a 60-foot-tall (18.3 meters) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo. The flight represents an important milestone in the establishment of the space tourism industry. Bezos did a round of televised interviews ahead of the launch, set for around 8 a.m. CDT (1300 GMT) from Blue Origin's Launch Site One facility some 20 miles (32 km) outside the rural Texas town of Van Horn. ""People keep asking if I'm nervous. I'm not really nervous, I'm excited. I'm curious. I want to know what we're going to learn,"" Bezos, founder of Amazon.com Inc, told the ""CBS This Morning"" program. ""We've been training. This vehicle is ready. This crew is ready. This team is amazing,"" Bezos said. ""We just feel really good about it."" Bezos and his brother Mark Bezos will be joined in the all-civilian crew by 82-year-old pioneering female aviator Wally Funk and 18-year-old Oliver Daemen https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-blueorigin/teenager-to-fly-with-bezos-in-inaugural-space-tourism-flight-idUSKBN2EL1ZJ?feedType=RSS&feedName=technologyNews, a recent high school graduate set to attend the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands to study physics and innovation management in September.  Daemen is the company's first paying customer. His father heads investment management firm Somerset Capital Partners. The flight comes nine days after rival Richard Branson, the British billionaire businessman, was aboard his company Virgin Galactic's rocket plane https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/virgin-galactics-branson-ready-space-launch-aboard-rocket-plane-2021-07-11 for its pioneering suborbital flight from New Mexico.  ""There's one person who was the first person in space. His name was Yuri Gagarin. And that happened a long time ago,"" Bezos said on the NBC's program ""Today,"" referring to the Soviet cosmonaut who reached space in 1961.  ""I think I'm going to be number 570 or something. That's where we're going to be in this list. So this isn't a competition. This is about building a road to space so that future generations can do incredible things in space,"" Bezos said. Funk was one of the so-called Mercury 13 group of women who trained to become astronauts for the first U.S. human spaceflight program in the early 1960s. She passed the same rigorous testing as the Mercury Seven male astronauts in NASA's space program, though the women were denied the chance to become astronauts because of their gender. ""Back when Wally was part of the Mercury 13, all the testing that she did, she outperformed all of the men,"" Bezos said on ""Today."" ""And we can confirm at 82 years old, she can still outperform all of the men. We've been doing the training with Wally. She can outrun all of us.""  (Reporting by Eric M.

"Ramkarpal (in white) and Ng (in yellow) delivering food aid to needy 
residents in Kampung Melayu. THE Penang government will prepare a complete report on the type of supplies handed out and details of recipients of the RM300,000 food basket programme once distribution is completed. Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow urged all MPs in Penang to ensure that distribution would be carried out in a proper way. He said the completed report would then be submitted to the relevant authorities. “This is compulsory for all states and it is important to prove that we are responsible when it comes to helping the vulnerable during this unprecedented time,” he said at a press conference after giving 329 food baskets at Jalan Kedah flats in George Town. Chow, who is Tanjung MP, said the food distribution programme would be completed soon and constituents of Padang Kota, Pengkalan Kota and Komtar were expected to receive a total of 3,000 food baskets. In Ayer Itam, Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh together with Ayer Itam assemblyman Joseph Ng distributed food baskets to needy families in Kampung Melayu. “In these trying times, it is essential to assist the people the best we can,” said Ramkarpal during the distribution recently. “We hope that the food and other essential items given will lessen their burden. “The Bukit Gelugor parliamentary constituency will be distributing more than 3,000 baskets in the coming weeks in various stages,” added Ramkarpal. He also said all assemblymen in the parliamentary constituency of Bukit Gelugor would be distributing baskets in their respective areas. “We will try our very best to reach out to as many as we can, particularly to B40 families in the constituency,” he added. In Balik Pulau, MP Muhammad Bakhtiar Wan Chik presented food baskets to members of fishermen’s associations there and also to staff of Escape Theme Park who were affected by its closure. “The whole process of distributing food aid will be completed in three weeks. “Today, we handed over 200 boxes of essentials,” he said during the recent distribution.

"FILE PHOTO: Representations of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency are seen in this illustration picture taken June 7, 2021.   REUTERS/Edgar Su/Illustration NEW YORK (Reuters) -     Bitcoin investment products and funds registered outflows for a second consecutive week, according to data from digital asset manager CoinShares released on Monday, highlighting investors' cautious sentiment on the cryptocurrency sector as prices continued to stall. Bitcoin outflows hit $10.4 million in the week ended July 16, after outflows of $6.9 million the previous week. For the month of July, bitcoin outflows amounted to $15 million, though inflows for the year were still a robust $4.2 billion. The overall crypto sector had net inflows of $2.9 million in the latest week, data showed.  The world's largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization was down 12.1% in price this month. On Monday, it was testing a key support of $30,000 and was last down 3.4% at $30,694. ""Bitcoin is looking precarious and is trading lower alongside global markets as concerns of economic recovery rise,"" said Pankaj Balani, chief executive officer at derivatives trading platform Delta Exchange. ""The volatility has also started to spike up... We can see sharp moves on the downside if bitcoin breaks below $30,000 convincingly,"" he added. That said, James Butterfill, investment strategist at CoinShares, pointed out that bitcoin outflows last week were minimal relative to May and June this year. He also believes that the timing of some of the crypto investment product launches, in which investors gained access for the first time, has led to recent profit-taking.     Ether-based investment products and funds, the token used for the Ethereum blockchain, had $11.7 million in net inflows last week. So far this year, ether inflows were close to $1 billion. Ether's price, however, was down 20% against the U.S. dollar, and was last 4% weaker at $1,819. Grayscale remains the largest crypto asset manager, but has seen its assets under supervision slide further, to $27.681 billion.  CoinShares, the second-biggest digital asset manager, saw its AUM dip to $3.1 billion from $3.3 billion the previous week.

"MBJB is mulling sending the homeless in Johor Baru to Anjung Singgah in Taman Nong Chik, which is run by the Welfare Department. — THOMAS YONG/The Star JOHOR Baru City Council (MBJB) is looking for temporary shelters to house the homeless, says mayor Datuk Adib Azhari Daud. He said this was necessary as construction of the Bangsa Johor Homeless Transit Centre in Taman Larkin Perdana had been delayed due to the lockdown and would only start in August. “We have already identified the Women Protection Centre in Taman Perling as one of the temporary shelters,” he said during the MBJB full board meeting, adding that it could take in about 120 people. Placing the homeless at the Women Protection Centre will involve a monthly expenditure of RM103,600 and another RM35,000 one-off payment to cover food and beverage, personal cleaning equipment, bedding and towels, staff allowances and other daily operating costs. MBJB is considering Anjung Singgah, in Taman Nong Chik, as a temporary shelter too. It is run by the Welfare Department and can take in 38 individuals sent by the city council. On the homeless transit centre, Adib said the two-storey building would house office space, treatment room, accommodation space, dining hall, surau, sick room and other amenities. “The transit building, which is expected to be completed by July next year, is designed to accommodate 200 people,” he said, disclosing that some 229 had registered so far. “MBJB will always give attention to the homeless as they are at high risk of being exposed to Covid-19,” he added. On a separate matter, Adib said MBJB was gathering information from traders renting the council’s premises and active barbershops as well as hair salons for the i-Incentive and i-Penjaja initiatives. “Applications will be channelled to the state government for them to get the RM500 one-off aid announced earlier,” he said. On the Covid-19 vaccination registration programme, Adib said MBJB was working closely with the Southern Volunteers. He said the programme would be extended until July 23 and thanked the Southern Volunteers for their efforts. He also said MBJB would continue to cooperate with Health Ministry in providing halls for vaccination, logistics and personnel to ensure a smooth process at vaccination centres (PPV). MBJB is directly involved at three PPV, namely Dewan Muafakat Johor Taman Adda, Persada International Convention Centre and Dewan Jubli Intan Sultan Ibrahim. “MBJB personnel are involved in tasks such as traffic, security and logistics to ensure a smooth vaccination process at these PPV,” he said.

"FILE PHOTO: An artist's rendering shows the possible look of a new fab for the chipmaker GlobalFoundries' in Singapore, in this handout picture obtained by Reuters on June 22, 2021. GlobalFoundries/Handout via REUTERS   (Reuters) -Semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries said on Monday it will build a second factory near its in Malta, New York, headquarters, and spend $1 billion to boost output to address the global chip shortage. GlobalFoundries, owned by the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, makes radio-frequency communications chips for 5G, chips for high-reliability manufacturing for automotive customers, and other specialized semiconductors. The new factory will be at GlobalFoundries' ""Fab 8"" site in upstate New York, where its headquarters moved from California earlier this year, it said at an event announcing the plans. The factory will double the site's chipmaking capacity and add 1,000 jobs, with funding from private-public partnerships, including federal and state investments. GlobalFoundries plans to spend $1 billion immediately to boost the existing factory's output by 150,000 wafers per year. Wafers are the silicon discs on which semiconductors are made in bulk, and each one can contain thousands of chips. ""This chip shortage has been in the making for a decade and a half,"" Chief Executive Thomas Caulfield said at the event attended by U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat. The news came after a bill containing $52 billion for semiconductor manufacturing passed the U.S. Senate this summer. It awaits action in the U.S. House of Representatives. ""We don't just want to create four, five or six more fabs, though we do want to do that. We need the whole ecosystem,"" Raimondo said at the event. Mubadala is planning to take GlobalFoundries public in an initial public offering, sources have told Reuters. The Wall Street Journal last week reported that Intel Corp was exploring acquiring GlobalFoundries for $30 billion. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters there are no active discussions with Intel yet, and Mubadala is focused on taking GlobalFoundries public as planned.

"Dine-in at Taman Harmoni Food Court in Sibu is only available if traders, staff and their customers have been vaccinated. THE no-vaccination, no-dine-in rule is being enforced at Taman Harmoni Food Court in Sibu, Sarawak. The same rule applies to the traders and their staff who will not be able to operate dine-in service if they have not been vaccinated. Sibu councillor Mohd Izkandar Abdullah said those who had received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine would be allowed to dine-in at the food court. “If there are traders and staff who have not been jabbed with at least one dose, they will not be allowed to open for dine-in. The State Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) has announced that dine-ins will be allowed from July 16. Mohd Izkandar said Sibu Municipal Council (SMC) would conduct inspections. “The traders must show their vaccination card or digital vaccination certificate on their MySejahtera app,” he said. Taman Selera Harmoni Sibu Islamic Traders Association chairman Abdul Taib Rosli said some traders were adopting a wait-and-see approach before opening their stalls, due to safety concerns. He said SMC had also tightened procedures and were only allowing one stallowner and two workers on the premises at a time. E-hailing driver Ngu Wu Pou is happy that dine-in is allowed under Phase Two of the National Recovery Plan. As he has been fully vaccinated with both doses, Ngu feels that eating out will be safe for him. Sibu Coffee Shop and Restaurant Owners Association chairman Tong Ing Kok said while a number of eateries were fully open for business, some were still only offering takeaway service. “I urge the operators to heed the SOP if they are opening for dine-in, to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” he said. Regarding people below 18, who are not eligible to be vaccinated and comprise children of food outlets operators, Tong hopes the authorities will be more understanding. “Some of these children help their parents at their restaurants,” he said. According to the dine-in SOP for food and beverage outlets, workers can only work if they have received at least one dose of the vaccine while the workforce is capped at 50% capacity. Other guidelines include a maximum of two people for dining in at a 1m-long table, four people at a 1.2m-long table, and six people at a 2m-long table. Workers and food suppliers have to observe physical distancing, wear a face mask and ensure body temperature scans are done. The SOP also states that the premises have to close for 14 days if a Covid-19 positive case is detected and that the operator must bear the sanitisation cost. Operation hours for eateries are from 6am to 10pm daily. HELP University offers two Foundation programmes: the Foundation in Arts and Foundation in Science.

"FILE PHOTO: The CNN logo stands outside the venue of the second Democratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidates debate, in the Fox Theater in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., July 30, 2019.    REUTERS/Brian Snyder (Reuters) -     AT&T-owned WarnerMedia will launch a new subscription streaming video news service in the first quarter of 2022, the company said Monday, as WarnerMedia prepares to join forces with Discovery as part of a proposed new company the telecom and media giants announced in May.  The CNN+ news service - which will exist separately from cable channels CNN, CNN international, CNN en Español and news and true crime channel HLN -  is geared toward “CNN superfans, news junkies and fans of quality non-fiction programming,” the company said in a press release.  CNN rivals such as Fox News have also sought new revenue from subscription news services geared toward superfans. It is not clear whether CNN President Jeff Zucker, who in February said he intended to leave CNN at the end of 2021, will stay and be involved with the CNN+ launch. Zucker and Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav, who will lead Discovery Warner Bros. - the proposed new company - are former colleagues and friends. At launch, CNN+ will feature 8-12 hours of live, daily programming, which will include both library content and new original series and films developed for the service. The streaming service will be available on the CNN app, which will also include TV feeds of CNN and related cable channels for pay TV subscribers.  AT&T Inc and Discovery said in May that they would combine content from WarnerMedia - including the Harry Potter and Batman franchises, CNN and sports programming - and Discovery's unscripted shows from lifestyle TV networks such as HGTV and TLC.  Warner Bros. Discovery is expected to see $3 billion in cost synergies with no plans to sell any assets. The deal is anticipated to close in mid-2022, pending approval by Discovery shareholders and regulators.  In a May call with reporters, Zaslav expressed his commitment to the news business, and said that CNN would be part of a news portfolio that includes Discovery’s news business in Poland and other local news assets around the world.  While at NBC, Zaslav helped launch the CNBC business news network, which is now a staple of Wall Street coverage.

"IPOH City Council has spent nearly RM1mil to clean up about 2,000 illegal dumpsites around the city. Ipoh mayor Datuk Rumaizi Baharin said about RM500 was used to clean up each location. “We have spent about RM1mil from Jan 1 until July 15, this money could have been used to repair or maintain facilities,” he said during a town hall session for the council’s 2022 Budget. Rumaizi said these illegal dumpsites were located in areas such as Jalan Othman Talib, Taman Rishah and the Bercham industrial site. “We will prepare about 27,000 free rubbish bins to be placed at various locations to make Ipoh the cleanest city by 2023. “We will sponsor about 10,000 while the others will be donated by private companies. “These bins will be placed at public parks, city centre, tourist spots and outside homes of the B40 group,” he added. Rumaizi said the city council also had plans to ensure that Ipoh would be a smart city with reduced carbon usage by 2030. “In order for Ipoh to be a low-carbon city, we will need a lot of trees. “There are currently about 200,000 trees providing shade in the city. “They need to be properly maintained, especially during the monsoon season, for the safety of road users,” he said. He further said that the city council was looking at providing more space for petty traders to operate. “To date, we have issued nearly 450 temporary permits which will expire by the end of the year. ”We are planning to extend the validity period and provide more space for traders in the future,” he added.

"FILE PHOTO: Luminar Technologies, Inc. Chief Executive Austin Russell poses for a photo at the self-driving car sensor maker's facility in Palo Alto, California, U.S., February 2021. Diana Rothery/Handout via REUTERS  . (Reuters) -     Luminar Technologies Inc, a maker of lidar sensors for self-driving cars, said on Monday that it has acquired a small chipmaker that makes a key part of its sensor. Palo Alto, California-based Luminar said it has agreed to purchase Wilmington, Massachusetts-based OptoGration Inc, with the deal expected to close in the third quarter. Luminar did not disclose the terms of the deal but said it would not have material impact on Luminar's cash position or share count. Luminar's lidar sensors beam out laser light and detect how it bounces back to help self-driving vehicles gain a three-dimensional view of the road.  The company is one of a half dozen firms that have either become publicly traded in the past year or are in the process of doing so, with all of them vying for lidar deals with automakers. Luminar has a deal with Volvo Cars to start putting its sensors on the roads in driver-assistance systems next year. Luminar's device uses a laser that operates at a wavelength of 1,550-nanometers, which it has said gives it the ability to detect objects further than most other lidars that use a 905-nanometer wavelength laser.  The drawback is materials costs, which automakers want to see fall in order to keep prices for self-driving features reasonable. The higher frequency laser requires a detector made of an exotic material called indium gallium arsenide. For the past five years, Luminar has worked with OptoGration to secure a custom laser light detector that keeps the volume of pricey materials to a mininum. Jason Eichenholz, co-founder and chief technology officer for Luminar, said the company will be acquiring OptoGration's team and factory, which has the ability to produce 1 million detectors per year and can scale up to 10 million. ""The key in this acquisition was the supply chain, to further strengthen what we have coming down the road and our ability to develop new technologies,"" Eichenholz told Reuters.

"Nor Aini (left) and Suhartini have their husbands and children who worry for them but understand their vital roles in the fight against Covid-19. SOMEONE shrieked from behind the partition at the sight of the needle, and the nurses could be heard calmly pacifying the person. They coaxed her into taking deep breaths until she felt ready to be jabbed at the government clinic in Bandar Baru Ayer Itam, Penang. Patiently vaccinating Penang’s frontliners with smiles on their faces, nurses are at the heart of the national inoculation effort. Matron Nor Aini Omar, 48, said they have met many different people and understand those with a fear of injection needles. “We calm them down and give them a few seconds to get comfortable. “We are trained for this and take pride in what we are doing to help bring down the Covid-19 cases,” she said at the clinic on Sunday when 117 of Penang’s media practitioners received their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Nor Aini added that “the job comes with great responsibility as we must make sure the vaccines do not go to waste.” “We take it seriously and follow all the set protocols. “It is different from normal clinic work but we have learnt the ropes,” she said. Nor Aini admitted to feeling a little anxious while vaccinating frontliners such as media practitioners who might have been exposed to the virus before showing up for vaccination. But with careful steps to keep each other safe through firm adherence to standard operating procedures, the task becomes less scary. “I have children and my husband at home, so when I go back after a day’s work, I hit the shower first before interacting with them. “They are equally inquisitive about my job and usually ask how it has been,” she said. Nurse Suhartini Soaid, 41, said the challenge of vaccinating the people was a rewarding one. “It is rewarding to be here and do this. We started in February and it has been ongoing since. “I do have kids at home who worry about me but they understand that we have created a safe environment for us and those we vaccinate here,” she said.

"FILE PHOTO: A Velodyne Lidar unit is seen on Camello, an autonomous grocery delivery robot, in Singapore April 6, 2021. REUTERS/Edgar Su (Reuters) -     Sensor maker Velodyne Lidar Inc said on Monday Chief Executive Officer Anand Gopalan would step down at the end of July, a little over a year after taking the role, sending its shares down nearly 6%. San Jose, California-based Velodyne will be led by a team consisting of several members of the senior leadership while it searches for a successor, it said.  The company did not give a reason for Gopalan's departure, and reiterated its fiscal 2021 revenue outlook of between $77 million and $94 million.  Velodyne did not immediately respond to a request seeking details on Gopalan's exit. The company's founder and former chairman David Hall had in June written a letter to the board calling for the resignation of Gopalan, Chairman Brad Culkin, directors Michael Dee and Christopher Thomas. Velodyne in February removed Hall as chairman and his wife Marta Thoma Hall as marketing chief on the grounds of lack of honesty, a charge Marta said the couple was not allowed to rebut. (https://reut.rs/3xTukB2) The company, one of several companies vying to supply automakers with lidar, a sensor that generates a three-dimensional map of the road ahead, is expected to report second-quarter results on Aug. 5.

"FILE PHOTO: Robinhood logo is seen on a smartphone in front of a displayed same logo in this illustration taken, July 2, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo (Reuters) -Robinhood Markets Inc is targeting a valuation of up to $35 billion in its initial public offering in the United States, the company revealed in a Monday filing, setting the stage for one of the most highly anticipated stock market listings this year. The listing plans come just months after the online brokerage found itself at the center of a confrontation between a new generation of retail investors and Wall Street hedge funds in late January. Robinhood was aiming for an IPO valuation of up to $40 billion, Reuters had previously reported. About 55 million shares are being offered in the IPO, with shares expected to be priced between $38 and $42, the company said. This would raise over $2.3 billion if priced at the top of the range. Nearly 2.63 million of those shares are being offered by the company's founders and chief financial officer, the filing showed. Proceeds from those will not go to Robinhood. Salesforce Ventures, the investment arm of software provider Salesforce.com Inc, is looking to purchase up to $150 million worth of Class A common stock at the IPO price, the filing showed. As revealed by Reuters in March, Robinhood plans to reserve some of its offering for users of the trading app. Between 20% and 35% of shares will be allocated to users, dependent on demand from customers and other investors, the filing said. In a separate statement, Robinhood said it would host a public event on July 24 to present its IPO plans and answer questions from potential investors. This is akin to traditional roadshows which companies and their advisers host with professional investment firms in the run-up to a share offering. Robinhood was founded in 2013 by Stanford University roommates Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. They will hold a majority of the voting power after the offering, the filing showed, with Bhatt having around 39% of the voting power of outstanding stock while Tenev will hold about 26.2%.  The company's platform allows users to make unlimited commission-free trades in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options and cryptocurrencies. Its easy-to-use interface made it a go-to for young investors trading from home during coronavirus-induced restrictions and its popularity has soared over the past 18 months. Robinhood has 18 million funded accounts as of Mar. 31, according to its filing. The trading mania in the so-called meme stocks helped fuel a four-fold jump in its revenue over January to March, Robinhood's IPO filing earlier this month detailed, but the quick expansion came at a cost. The company faced criticism after it was forced to curb trading in the middle of the surge this year in GameStop and other previously beaten-down stocks. At the time, Robinhood was forced to raise $3.4 billion in emergency funds after its finances were strained by the massive jump in retail trading and a resulting jump in capital demands from clearing houses. That round valued the company at around $30 billion, according to people familiar with matter. Robinhood's stock market flotation comes amid a record 15-month run for the U.S. IPO market, as investors rushed to buy shares of high-growth tech companies.  The company plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""HOOD"".  Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for the offering.

"FILE PHOTO: Woman with her smartphone poses in front of displayed Duolingo logo in this illustration taken, June 29, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration (Reuters) -Duolingo Inc said on Monday it aims to be valued as much as $3.41 billion in its U.S. initial public offering, as the language-learning app maker seeks to cash in on rapidly rising interest for online education tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 5.1 million shares will be offered in the IPO, priced between $85 and $95 each, which would rake in more than $485 million at the top end of that range. On a fully diluted basis, which includes securities such as stock options and restricted stock units, Duolingo would be valued at $4.38 billion at the maximum price.  Nearly 1.4 million shares will be offered by the selling stockholders, proceeds from which will not go to the company. Duolingo has about 40 million monthly active users learning 40 languages, including Irish and Hawaiian, for which the company claims there are more online learners than there are native speakers.  The Pittsburgh-based company said earlier it had more than doubled its revenue in the first quarter this year, with 72% of it generated from subscriptions and nearly 17% from advertising. With more than 500 million downloads, its app is the top-grosser in the education category on both Google Play and Apple's App Store. The company was founded in 2011 by Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker, who met at Carnegie Mellon University when von Ahn was a computer science professor and Hacker, his doctoral student.

"TO HELP strengthen Malaysia’s healthcare system in coping with the recent surge of Covid-19 patients, Maybank is donating RM14mil to urgently upgrade the capacity at two public hospitals. The contribution, to be channeled via Mercy Malaysia’s Covid-19 Hospital Surge Capacity Support Programme, will see the deployment of critically-needed equipment and personnel to Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) and Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital (HTAR) in Klang, beginning from the fourth week of July 2021. Maybank Chairman Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa said the group viewed with concern the increasing number of Covid-19 patients of late and the resulting strain on the nation’s medical infrastructure. “We recognise the challenges faced by our hospitals and heroic frontliners, as well as the anguish of the patients and their loved ones who may face delays due to the overwhelming number of cases,” he said. “We felt it was essential that all efforts be made to alleviate the critical need for medical support at this time and offer relief to both the patients and frontliners,"" he added. Mercy Malaysia president Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Perdaus said the organisation was honoured by the continued support from Maybank, which began in 2014. ""The latest funding shows the recognition and trust Maybank has in our work as a non-profit organisation where pre-emptive sources of funding are key to delivering emergency humanitarian response,” he said. Zamzamzairani said the programme will be carried out over an estimated 20-week period via a three-pronged approach - the provision of health equipment and supplies; mobilisation of human resources; and technical training, including in mental health and psychosocial support. “It will result in the ICU bed capacity for Category 4 and 5 Covid-19 patients increasing by six units in HTAR and 10 units in HKL, as well as an additional 200 Covid-19 patient beds at each of these two hospitals,” he said. “At the same time, it will also add 40 health workers and support staff for HTAR and 50 for HKL, to serve at both Covid-19 and non-Covid wards, thereby enabling outpatient departments to re-open and serve patients.” The initiative will also see more medical staff trained in the proper handling of Covid-19 cases as well as provide a wide range of much-needed ICU and non-ICU medical equipment, including for both the hospitals’ emergency departments. These include close to 4,000 medical and supporting equipment such as blood pressure monitors, ECG and cardiac machines, oxygen flow meters, defibrillators, ventilators, oxygen concentrators, critical care vital monitors and ICU beds, among others. Recognising the need to reduce the burnout rate and mental health challenges among frontline health workers, the programme will also provide mental health and psychosocial support services through reliable health management modules and mechanisms, and deliver direct aid to reduce the livelihood burdens of these workers and their family members. Zamzamzairani said that given the especially acute capacity challenges at HTAR, Maybank’s contribution will also see the setting up of a temporary field hospital there together with the provision of technical training to augment the treatment and recovery of Covid-19 patients. This will help reduce the existing load at the ICU and general wards by the active management of Category 3 patients. “Our hope is that by working together with the health authorities, Mercy Malaysia and all Malaysians, the sustainability of our nation’s healthcare system will be assured, and our hospitals will be better equipped and prepared to face not only the current Covid-19 outbreak, but also other future unexpected pandemics,” he said. “As a group committed to humanising financial services, we will continue to do our utmost to support the communities we serve so that we can sustain lives and help contain the spread of the disease, while reducing the risks and stress for frontline workers.” Prior to this collaboration with Mercy Malaysia, the Maybank Group had, in 2020, contributed more than RM20mil to support various Covid-19 relief efforts such as through the provision of medical and personal protective equipment to hospitals, aid for the disadvantaged, provision of washing stations for marginalised communities and supplies of essential kits to health facilities for infection prevention and control. The group also offered its digital fund-raising platform MaybankHeart which saw more than RM500,000 raised to support various causes in the fight against Covid-19.

"The length of time footballers are spending on these games, often long into the night, is what has made clubs start to take notice. — 123rf.com When you think of addiction, the first things that come to mind are gambling, alcohol and drug abuse. Footballers down the ages have not been immune to falling into either of those vice’s grips – some of the best players to have ever graced the pitch, George Best, Diego Maradona and Paul Gascoigne to name but a few. But there is one addiction, previously seen as a harmless bit of fun, that is becoming a serious issue among professional footballers, of all levels – a compulsion to play computer games. “It is football’s silent epidemic,” sports psychotherapist Steve Pope told Reuters. “Anything footballers cannot get tested for they love. “You try get a computer controller off a gaming addict. It is like taking a bottle of whisky away from an alcoholic. It is just as big a problem as drugs and alcohol abuse. “Players have been going two or three days straight playing games. They are urinating in the bin in their room so they don’t have to get up. It is a national problem but footballers are even more vulnerable due to their nature.” Technology has advanced to unprecedented levels to make games like   an immersive experience, where you can compete online against people all over the world. And it is this competitive element that has created such a problem among footballers, and seen Pope’s workload increase by three times during Covid-19 lockdowns. “We are going to see these players who have been turned into warriors from the age of six – they are all win, win, win, we create them to seek a high,” Pope added. , against others, it is Pandora’s box. Footballers are bred to do this kind of competition. “Lockdown has made things much worse. You don’t wait for the drug dealer, you open your console and get your high. I have not been on lockdown, it has been bedlam.” So-called gaming disorder was only listed as a mental health condition by the World Health Organisation in 2018, while in October 2019, the NHS in the UK launched the first National Centre for Gaming Disorders to treat patients aged between 13 and 25. Nationwide figures are therefore difficult to gather, given it has only recently been recognised as a serious issue, but with more and more afflicted players coming forward, such research is coming. “We normally help people with more common addictions like gambling and we don’t have specific sessions for computer games yet, but that stuff will be coming out very soon,” Alex Mills, Head of Education at Sporting Chance, a charity set up by former England captain Tony Adams to support athletes on a variety of mental and emotional health problems, told Reuters. “From going into football clubs, they are asking me to talk about gaming. They wouldn’t be saying that if they didn’t think it was a problem. “There are sportspeople coming to us who might not say ‘we are having an issue with computer games’ but when talking to them it becomes apparent that the issues they are coming to us with, like a relationship breakdown, have been significantly influenced by behaviour, like spending an inordinate amount of time on a computer game.” The length of time footballers are spending on these games, often long into the night, is what has made clubs start to take notice. “If somebody is playing for 10 hours straight, often every day, they are not eating properly, and their sleep becomes affected,” said Jeff Whitley, a former Manchester City midfielder and now the Professional Players’ Association (PFA) player welfare executive. “If they are doing that, their body will not let them perform to how clubs want them to, which is making more clubs aware.” Computer game companies themselves, Pope insists, have played their part. “The gaming companies are sanitising things,” Pope added. “(Tottenham Hotspur’s) Dele Alli and Harry Kane were being paid to play games. Would a football club condone any player advertising whisky now? No, so why is it fine to advertise gaming?” Attitudes are changing, given the effect it is having on player performance, much to the relief of those championing greater awareness. “Ten years ago, it was seen as a joke by clubs, but Fleetwood Town (English third-tiered side) who I used to work with took it seriously,” Pope says. “We kept it under control and got four promotions in five seasons. Funnily enough, the only player who ignored it (gaming) was (Leicester City striker) Jamie Vardy. He said he did his gaming on the pitch. “We used to take so much ridicule, but now clubs, from the Premier League down, are finally starting to see the light. It has just taken a while to get here.” DESPITE clinical psychology being a very young profession in Malaysia, it does not mean the service is not needed by people.

"Dr Zainal: Dining indoors at eateries should be limited to those who have been vaccinated. HEALTH experts are divided over whether eateries in the Klang Valley should limit dine-in based on proof of Covid-19 vaccination. While the move could infringe on the rights of customers, some say it could help the flailing food and beverage sector stay afloat. Malaysian Public Health Physicians Association president Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar said such a move could be considered for indoor premises. “Outdoor areas can be open to all, but indoor areas should be limited to those who have been vaccinated,” he told StarMetro.Zainal said eatery operators should ensure proper ventilation within their indoor premises. He also called on the authorities to step up inspections to ensure diners comply with the standard operating procedure. Universiti Malaya’s Social and Preventive Medicine Department Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming is against making dining in conditional upon one’s vaccination status. She said the same safety measures, such as wearing a mask and maintaining physical distancing, should apply to everyone. “Outdoor dine-in where there is good airflow should be allowed, but indoors, where ventilation is poor, can be risky,” she added. Malaysian Society of Infection Control and Infectious Diseases patron Datuk Dr Christopher Lee said the move was unlikely to help struggling establishments much because of the relatively low number of people who had received their shots. “At the moment, it is not practical. Implementing this means that we have to ensure all workers have been vaccinated too,” he pointed out. Universiti Putra Malaysia epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman cautioned that relaxing dine-in restrictions could exacerbate the outbreak of the more transmissible Delta variant. “The virus is known to infect people through bodily fluid or aerosolised particles in confined spaces. “These particles may linger in the air for up to 16 hours, exposing patrons to infections,” she noted. She said dine-in should only be allowed after a significant proportion of the population had been fully vaccinated. The food and beverage sector had in recent weeks stepped up calls for the government to loosen restrictions in view of flailing businesses. Restaurant and Bistro Owners Association, in a report by The Star on July 14, warned that 60% of establishments could close permanently in the next two months if the ban continued. Its media adviser Jeremy Lim, when contacted, said the suggestion to limit dine-in to vaccinated individuals was doable but needed more details. “For a while now, people have been tossing about this idea of vaccine passports. Maybe we can implement that locally first,” he said. Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin had announced on July 15 that the government was planning to allow fully vaccinated individuals to travel and dine in at restaurants. Dine-in is currently off-limits for states under Phase One of the National Recovery Plan. In Singapore, fully vaccinated individuals can dine in at eateries in groups of five while those not vaccinated can do so only in pairs or alone starting July 19. In France, eateries, shopping centres and trains will be out of bounds for those not vaccinated starting next month.

"Beh (right) presenting a mock cheque for RM10,000 to DHRRA president Saravanan M. Sinapan and its secretary-general Jaslin Nadia Isham. Health supplements company VitaHealth, through its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative VCareForYou, has donated RM10,000 to the CovidCareMy 3.0 Covid-19 Response Fund. The contribution will go towards supporting families across Malaysia whose livelihoods have been impacted by the pandemic. “Giving back to the community has always been a core part of our corporate culture. “We remain committed to upholding our CSR to make meaningful contributions to the community,” said VitaHealth Malaysia and Singapore country head KS Beh. CovidCareMy is an immediate crisis response initiative launched by the Development of Human Resources for Rural Areas (DHRRA) Malaysia in collaboration with 20 local non-governmental organisations. It works to ensure no one has been left behind since the implementation of the movement control order in March last year. DHRRA is a non-profit organisation with almost two decades of community development experience, particularly in promoting empowered and self-reliant communities through grassroots development initiatives. Through the CovidCareMy initiative, DHRRA aims to build the resilience of affected communities nationwide by providing assistance and counselling services. Under the initiative, each marginalised family receives an emergency aid basket worth RM150 comprising groceries, food items, face masks and sanitisers. The provisions for a family of five are estimated to last two weeks. Additionally, CovidCareMy is also engaging a small pool of daily wage earners to increase their income-generating opportunities in the following ways: l Members of B40 communities pack groceries for distribution and get paid in return. l Taxi and e-hailing drivers earn by delivering groceries to beneficiaries. Affected communities will be able to access support and assistance via these hotlines: 017-780 3054/ 03-7887 3371. “We are truly honoured to lend a helping hand to DHRRA’s initiative to ease the burden of communities who are adversely affected by the pandemic,” said Beh. “We are all in this together, and we will get through this together. “Once our employees are fully vaccinated, we will step up our community outreach efforts to help those who need it the most during these difficult times.” DESPITE clinical psychology being a very young profession in Malaysia, it does not mean the service is not needed by people.

"FILE PHOTO: People carry a poster with photographs of Cuba's late President Fidel Castro, Cuba's President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Miguel Diaz-Canel and Cuba's former President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Raul Castro during a rally in Havana, Cuba, July 17, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini/File Photo (Reuters) -     Years before becoming president of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel pushed for greater public access to the internet at a time when it was only available to a tiny minority. He would eventually succeed in getting much of his country online. Now, just across the Florida Straits, his opponents in Miami's Cuban exile community are taking full advantage of Cuba'a expanded internet access. The Cuban government has accused independent media outlets largely based in the Miami area of provoking the unprecedented, spontaneous protests that spread across Cuba a week ago. One of the sites it singled out, ADN Cuba, slants its coverage against the government in Havana at every turn. It recently published a photograph of Diaz-Canel that was altered to look like a police mugshot. ""Genocide,"" it said underneath. Its coverage of the protests has concentrated heavily on the people hurt or detained. For days the site led with a story that the nephew of a senior Communist Party leader called on his family and the government to ""lay down your weapons"" and ""listen to the people."" Another headline reported protesters in eastern Cuba shouted ""murderer"" at Deputy Prime Minister Ramiro Valdes. Aiming for a young audience, Miami Beach-based Diario de Cuba closely follows Cuban and Cuban-American musicians critical of the government.  One recent front page featured separate headlines on the latest news and views from musicians Pitbull, Lenier Mesa and Maykel Osorbo, while also reporting that Silvio Rodriguez, a longtime ally of Cuba's government, was trying to ""rescue"" artists who have abandoned the government. Around a dozen such Cuba-focused news and magazines have their websites blocked in Cuba, but Cubans can access them anyway using virtual private network (VPN) services, and share them on social media sites generally available in Cuba.  Some relentlessly berate the government while others, though still critical, strive for more fact-based journalism like the pioneering outlet 14yMedio.  The independent site El Toque, which also has a number of Cuba-based staff, published an article debunking false anti-government reports and out-of-context photos circulating on the internet that grossly inflated the size of the demonstrations.    While it is difficult to measure the impact of the U.S.-based sites on recent protests in Cuba, the government there certainly sees them as a menace. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez dedicated much of a news conference last week to criticizing ADN Cuba and two journalists by name while also condemning a social media hashtag campaign boosted by bots. He accused opposition media of working for the U.S. government, which funds a number of Cuban opposition media  websites with hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, according to U.S. records published by the Cuba Money Project. Protesters in Cuba have also spread messages of discontent and word of protests on social media platforms, mostly Facebook, and encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram. Many of those sites were blocked following the protests, prompting U.S. President Joe Biden to say he would review whether Washington could help Cubans regain internet access.  Even without U.S. help, Cubans find ways to see censored content with circumvention tools such as Psiphon. The company says up to 1.4 million Cubans were using its application to see banned content on some days last week, up from 18,000 per day before the protests. That would mean 20% of Cuba's estimated 7 million internet users used that one tool to get around censors. In 2013, when he was heir apparent to former President Raul Castro, Diaz-Canel said that continuing to ban the internet in Cuba was an ""almost impossible delusion that doesn't make sense."" Internet access gradually expanded after that and the landscape changed dramatically in December 2018 when Cubans were able to get internet service on their mobile phones for the first time. Readership of opposition media inside Cuba exploded, said Baruch College professor Ted Henken, editor of the recently published book ""Cuba's Digital Revolution."" Henken talks to the media outlets, which track their traffic through Google Analytics and other methods. ""Since December 2018 these outlets have gained a huge island audience and left the official media even more exposed as propagandists,"" Henken said. ""They (the Cuban leadership) miscalculated in that they didn't realize that this would very quickly, in two and a half years, blow up in their face."" Rodriguez last week accused ADN Cuba and others of carrying out a plan for which ""U.S. imperialism has worked for a long time."" The U.S. government does provide financial assistance to media outlets critical of the Cuban government.  A company closely associated with ADN Cuba received  $410,710 from the U.S. Agency for International Development to promote human rights in Cuba last year, journalist Tracey Eaton reported via the Cuba Money Project, which tracks the spending through public records and Freedom of Information Act requests. Representatives for USAID did not respond to a request for comment over the weekend. ADN Cuba's founder also did not respond to requests for comment. The two journalists named by Rodriguez declined interviews. Another anti-government website, CubaNet, received $300,000 from USAID in 2020, its director acknowledged.  Once a biweekly newsletter printed in Miami, CubaNet now has a team in Cuba in defiance of the authorities, and has published stories on the apparent wealth of the Castro family.  Director Hugo Landa said ""we have never hidden"" the U.S. funding and that U.S. officials have never tried to influence coverage. ""If we ever felt any pressure from any of our funders to influence our content, I would renounce that support,"" Landa said. With or without U.S. funding, the sites are trying to reach readers like Jorge Norris, a 35-year-old IT engineer in Cuba, who uses a VPN to read sites such as Diario de Cuba and 14yMedio along with official Cuban media.  ""It's another view to be able to form an idea of what's happening in the world,"" Norris said. ""You have to be completely informed of what they say here in Cuba and in the world.""

"Prof Dr Hilmi delivering his speech at the virtual closing ceremony of ESTCON2020. THE World Engineering, Science and Technology Congress (ESTCON) 2020 was a success despite being organised virtually for the first time since its inauguration in 2010. The three-day congress, in its sixth edition, recorded an impressive turnout with more than 1,000 experts from the academic fraternity, industry, government agencies and non-governmental organisations from some 30 countries. Themed “Science, Technology and Humanities: Reinventing the Future”, it covered a wide range of topics from innovation, engineering and technology to humanities as well as addressing the latest trends and challenges. ESTCON2020, a Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP) flagship event, set the stage for key players from around the globe to connect and share knowledge while seeking innovative solutions and methods in forging a sustainable future for the next generation. They were the International Conference on Oil and Gas Engineering and Technology (ICOGET 2020); International Conference on Civil, Offshore and Environmental Engineering (ICCOEE 2020); International Conference on Production, Energy and Reliability (ICPER 2020); International Conference on Earth Resources (ICER 2020); International Conference on Process Engineering and Advanced Materials (ICPEAM 2020); International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced System (ICIAS 2020); International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences (ICCOINS 2020); International Conference on Fundamental and Applied Sciences (ICFAS 2020); and International Conference for Management, Social Sciences and Humanities (ICMeSH2020). Speaking at the virtual closing ceremony, Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry (Mosti) secretary-general Datin Paduka Dr Siti Hamisah Tapsir said: “ESTCON2020 has been a force to reckon with when it comes to resonating the ideas and aspirations of industries and academics with regard to science, technology and humanities. “Through this congress, we were able to catch a glimpse of what we could do more of and how we could contribute to this new era in these unprecedented times. “I am indeed encouraged by UTP’s efforts to initiate this platform that promotes collaboration among industry leaders, higher institutions of learning and the governments, which in turn will step up and seek opportunities to forge a sustainable future for generations to come,” she added. Awards for Best Speaker and Best Paper were also given out at the closing ceremony, aside from the announcement of 10 winners of the congress’ Gamification feature where prizes were won through points earned for active participation. “I believe we all have the same aspiration in reinventing the future of Science, Technology and Humanities,” said UTP academic deputy vice-chancellor and ESTCON2020 co-chairman Prof Dr Hilmi Mukhtar. “During these three days, we have seen the possibility of these dreams becoming reality. “The pandemic has hit hard for all of us, and we need to undergo changes that will decide our survival in the future. “There is indeed plenty to reflect upon and if this in any way enhances our individual and collective contributions to meeting the global challenges, then the congress can truly be considered a success,” he added. ESTCON2020 was co-organised by the Alliance of Government-Linked Universities, with support from the Higher Education Ministry, Mosti and Academy of Sciences Malaysia in collaboration with Petronas, Yayasan UTP and the Malaysia Board of Technologists. The event’s main sponsors were Dialog Group Berhad, Schlumberger, Transwater, Creative Minds, Uzma Berhad, NeuDimension, Maybank, Patentsworth International, Techsource Systems and Telekom Malaysia.

"A plant wall with Procter & Gamble's logo is pictured at the entrance to the company's highly automated cleaning products factory in Tabler Station, West Virginia, U.S., May 28, 2021. Picture taken May 28, 2021. REUTERS/Timothy Aeppel CINCINNATI/TABLERS STATION, W.V. (Reuters) -     Procter & Gamble Co may be best known for laundry detergent and toothpaste, but its secret sauce is arguably figuring out how to do things like get two red bottles of Olay skin lotion into blister packs as cheaply and accurately as possible. That task is currently done by hand at its factories. But at one of the conglomerate's secretive robotics labs on the outskirts of Cincinnati, researchers have programmed a robot to do the job. It's a surprisingly tricky maneuver for a machine. The robot arm plucks two bottles at a time from a box and lays them into the dimples with the labels facing forward so they're visible when the package is sealed. ""That's the key - getting the labels exactly oriented,"" said Mark Lewandowski, director of robotics innovation at P&G's global engineering center, pointing to the test line he's set up inside the facility. ""We'll be rolling this out in the next month or two"" to P&G's factories, he said.  Many companies make consumer goods. Yet it's ones who can make them the most eye-catching for consumers, and do it as cheaply as possible, that do best. In that regard, P&G is a model and its use of high-speed automation and robots is a key to its success. P&G is the world's largest consumer-goods maker and dominates many of its businesses. For example, analysts estimate its Bounty brand accounts for 40% of all paper towels sold in the United States. Investors appreciate its steady profits and dividends. The company has raised its dividend 65 years in a row. To be sure, P&G is mainly known as a branding expert, not a designer of factory machines. But developing key pieces of its own automation has helped it compete in businesses where shaving fractions of a penny off the cost of making each Pampers diaper and Gillette 	razor blade is essential.  And the pressure to cut costs is stronger than ever. Like other manufacturers, P&G is pushing through price increases to offset a surge in raw material and shipping costs. ""In commodity businesses like P&G's, price is everything,"" said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies the impact of automation. ""For that kind of business, you need scale and efficiency,"" and that means staying on the cutting edge of production technology. Lewandowski's lab, tucked in a nondescript brick building surrounded by suburban shopping plazas, works on robots that could end up in a factory at any one of P&G's six main business units. The robot that handles Olay bottles, for example, was developed as part of a larger challenge of creating machines and grippers that can handle bottles and tubes of many shapes and sizes and get them into increasingly complex packaging. ""Everyone talks about the Amazon challenge - the gripping and picking,"" said Lewandowski, referring to the online retailing giant. But for P&G, it isn't enough to just get a bottle into a box.  Consumer products designers are constantly dreaming up new shapes and sizes of containers, sometimes adding features like pour spouts or clamp-down lids, to help products stand out on grocery shelves. That can mean costly adjustments to machinery every time a line switches to a new product. The COVID-19 pandemic has sped up the development of some new automated systems. At many P&G factories, Lewandowski noted, clusters of hourly workers come together - often shoulder to shoulder - to assemble special assortments or the cardboard displays that highlight products at the end of grocery aisles. ""People are still the ultimate machine"" for that job, he said. But over the past year, he's found ways to automate more of it - in part to aid social distancing. This push to automate this hand work is likely to continue beyond the pandemic, he noted, because P&G's factories are struggling to find workers willing to do these jobs in tight labor markets. In addition to Lewandowski's lab, P&G operates a network of separate research centers that focus on automation problems unique to each business.  A few miles away, for instance, is a research center devoted to the fabric and homecare business. This lab, with a huge vintage advertising photo of a woman hanging up laundry on a clothesline in the entry, has existed for three decades. But only in the last five years has it created a section that focuses on pure robotics rather than more generic automated machinery. Roger Williams, the lab's technical director, estimates that only 20% of the automation in P&G's factories involves true robots, which are slower than ""fixed automation"" such as machines that squirt detergent into a bottle or fasten caps. But that is up from 10% a decade ago. Williams said he always has a ""hit list"" of 15 projects on the floor of his lab, each aimed at determining the feasibility of using robots for a given task. He was recently asked, for instance, to determine if a robot could stuff bags of powdered detergent into boxes - a relatively new type of packaging for their Tide brand. ""That one didn't move forward,"" he said. While it was possible, the cost to install and program the robots didn't justify the investment for a relatively small-volume item. Another project, still underway, is aimed at finding a way to move a new bottle cap type onto the detergent-bottle filling assembly line. That is typically done with a ""unscrambler,"" a mechanism that shakes and turns piles of caps until they are oriented to feed into the filling machine. The new caps can't go through that because they include a delicate device that could be damaged. ""We're working on a robot that will pick up 40 caps at a time and index them into the final system,"" he said. At one of the company's newest plants, in Tablers Station, West Virginia, robots dot the production floor. On a recent day, fast-moving arms were plucking pink Pantene hair conditioner tubes and placing them onto a line to be filled.  ""We're always looking for places where we need flexibility and agility,"" said Jim Utter, a project manager at the plant. One of the big opportunities he sees is adding more mobile robots, which could be used to move bundles of parts between different parts of the plant. The newest models can find their way around unexpected obstacles, rather than relying on fixed tracks.  ""That's essential in place like this, where everything is always moving,"" he said.

"Wong says Penang E-Learning Computer Programme has donated 1,562 laptops at a cost of RM2.02mil. POOR WiFi connectivity remains a major barrier to many doing home-based teaching and learning while schools remain closed. Those who received digital devices under the Penang E-Learning Programme are now equipped with the necessary hardware, but Internet connectivity remains a problem for some. Their circumstances were highlighted during an online engagement session with Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow, Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association (MSIA) and Penang E-Learning Computer Programme chairman Chong Eng on Saturday. Among them was SM Convent Bukit Mertajam student V. Praveena, 17, who spoke on behalf of her friends. While she thanked the Penang government for the computers that her friends and she received, she highlighted the troubled network connection. “It was hard for me and my brother to attend online classes because we shared our parents’ phone. Now, with help from the government, we can attend all classes. “But many students including my friends face Internet connection problems. I wonder if the government can provide free data or WiFi facilities for such students,” she said. SK Sungai Ara senior assistant Azani Abdullah said 33 pupils in the school received digital devices from the state’s programme and if they could have WiFi support, it would further boost their learning abilities. “We identified those who are keen in online learning but some are still left out. “Although pupils who previously faced difficulty in obtaining devices are now showing better attendance after being provided with computers, having sufficient WiFi connectivity will be an added help as many still rely on their parents’ phones to connect to the Internet,” she said. SK Sin Ya headmaster Beh Khoon Seng said lack of Internet connection was a common problem, but it should not be a reason for children to be left out of education. “Once education is missed, they are left out and their future is affected. “About 90% of pupils who are absent from online classes said it was due to lack of Internet access. “Any assistance will be of great help to low-income families. “I hope the students who got help with getting computers will also receive assistance to obtain Internet connection,” he said. MSIA president Datuk Seri Wong Siew Hai said so far, Penang E-Learning Computer Programme had disbursed about RM2mil worth of laptops and hopes it will continue growing. “We are delighted to pool all resources and donate 1,562 laptops at a cost of RM2.02mil donated by 27 companies. “Every single sponsorship counts and nothing is too small,” he said. Chow said the issue of Internet connectivity had always been a concern of the government as there were still weaknesses in the infrastructure. “There is no quick solution as it takes time for service providers to perfect their coverage. “We believe the initiation of the country’s connectivity plan will resolve the problem in years to come. “For a short-term measure, we got sponsorship from YTL Communications. “Having connectivity is an important component to ensure the success of Penang E-Learning Programme,” he said.

"In its report that was released earlier this week, Citizen Labs has said that Candiru’s spyware (called DevilsTongue by Microsoft) can infect and monitor iPhones, Android smartphones, Macs, PCs and even cloud accounts. — 123rf.com Zero-day bug attack: Google and Microsoft have released a patch to two critical vulnerabilities in their operating systems that were exploited by a spyware that has reportedly been sold to governments by Israeli developer Candiru. In its report that was released earlier this week, Citizen Labs has said that Candiru’s spyware (called DevilsTongue by Microsoft) can infect and monitor iPhones, Android smartphones, Macs, PCs and even cloud accounts. Microsoft is calling Candiru Sourgum. Microsoft in a blog post said that the spyware was being used in precision attacks targeting more than 100 victims including politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers and political dissidents in countries around the world including around the world including Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Spain, United Kingdom, Turkey, Armenia, and Singapore. DevilsTongue is a spyware tool developed by a Tel Aviv, Israel-based company called Candiru. As Citizen Labs explains it, Candiru is a ‘mercenary’ spyware firm that markets ‘untraceable’ spyware to government customers. Their product offering includes solutions for spying on computers, mobile devices, and cloud accounts. “The €16 million project proposal allows for an unlimited number of spyware infection attempts, but the monitoring of only 10 devices simultaneously. For an additional €1.5M, the customer can purchase the ability to monitor 15 additional devices simultaneously, and to infect devices in a single additional country. For an additional €5.5M, the customer can monitor 25 additional devices simultaneously, and conduct espionage in five more countries,” Citizen Labs wrote in its report. Once the spyware has infected a Windows PC, it exfiltrates files, exporting all messages saved in the Windows version of the popular encrypted messaging app Signal, and stealing cookies and passwords from  Microsoft’s analysis has also shown that the spyware can also send messages from logged-in email and social media accounts directly on the victim’s computer. This could allow malicious links or other messages to be sent directly from a compromised user’s computer. To tackle this spyware, Microsoft has released a security patch for two zero-day bug vulnerabilities – CVE-2021-31979 and CVE-2021-33771. These vulnerabilities were patched in a security update released on July 13, 2021. “To limit these attacks, we focused on two actions. First, we built protections into our products against the unique malware Sourgum created, and we shared those protections with the security community. Second, we issued a software update that will protect Windows customers from exploits Sourgum was using to help deliver its malware,” Microsoft said in a post. “We’ve built protections against DevilsTongue into our security products, and we’ve shared these protections with others in the security community so they can protect their customers,” the company added. Google in a separate report by its Threat Analysis Group or TAG discovered a bunch of zero-day bug vulnerabilities in   that were being used by the same company. The company found vulnerabilities CVE-2021-21166 and CVE-2021-30551 in Chrome, CVE-2021-33742 in Internet Explorer and CVE-2021-1879 in Safari WebKit. Thankfully, all the three companies – Apple, Google and Microsoft – have released security updates to patch these bugs.

"Lim working on his mathematical model based on daily new cases per district and the RO rate. He says he still needs to incorporate ICU data. — ZHAFARAN NASIB/The Star IN his bid to help the country contain the Covid-19 virus, Penangite Dr David Benjamin Lim has come up with a programme to better gauge the situation at the district level. His model, meant to help the gradual reopening of the economic sectors, is based on two things — the daily new cases per 100,000 population in a district and the R-naught (RO) infection rate. What he needs now is the intensive care unit (ICU) capacity rate in the state, which he believes could better help in his calculation. “The reopening criteria for this model are how big the problem is (number of cases) as well as how fast it is growing (R0 value). “If the daily number of cases in a district is consistently the same with no drastic spike, and the hospital ICU capacity is running fine, then life can go back to normal in that district. “In my personal opinion, reducing some restrictions in certain districts should not be a problem right now. “We also do have the advantage of being vaccinated as well,” he said when met at his home in Bayan Lepas on Thursday. Lim, 28, has a PhD in Pure Mathematics from Stanford University in the United States. It took him 60 hours over five days to write a code to calculate these values from scratch in a way that is easily applicable to districts in any state in Malaysia. He said he would propose the programme to Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow next week. Citing an example, Lim said the overall number of cases in Penang would go up if there was a cluster reported in only one district. “But this would not show a proper representation of the situation in the state as a whole. “When you group the five districts in Penang together and show a high number of cases, it does not equally represent all the districts in Penang. “The same analogy can be said about Malaysia as some states have a far higher number of cases than others, like Selangor. “It is not a fair measure to lump all the states together. “For example, suppose you group people together and calculate their net worth but one person in the group has a much higher worth than the others. “In this situation, the average is not an accurate representation of the net worth of a randomly selected person from this group,” he said. According to Lim, the reopening approach would require deciding what the safe and dangerous thresholds are, which in theory could be deduced from the ICU capacity rates. “I cannot incorporate ICU data into my reopening approach right now as this statistic is not publicly available. “It is still possible to infer what is safe and dangerous empirically. “For Penang, we know in the past when ICUs were full, we could use the new case numbers/R0 rate to set thresholds in my approach,” he said. Lim added that he hoped the Federal Government would use his method in its decision-making process to win the war against Covid-19, and help the suffering economic sectors.

"Internet curbs in Hong Kong have US businesses on edge, with the American Chamber of Commerce calling for the free flow of information to be protected. — AP Photo US businesses in Hong Kong fear mainland Chinese internet curbs and want local authorities to commit to the free flow of information, the head of the city's American Chamber of Commerce said Monday. Hong Kong has long marketed itself as an international business centre, free from China's controls and the ""Great Firewall"" used to censor online content. But Beijing has started remoulding the city in its own authoritarian image as it cracks down on dissent following huge and often violent pro-democracy protests two years ago. A sweeping new security law imposed last year has criminalised much dissent and given authorities a suite of new controls, including internet takedown powers. The latest measure to worry business owners is a proposed privacy law that will hold international tech companies and their employees criminally liable for illegal content that users post. Tara Joseph, president of the local American Chamber of Commerce, said the government needed to address the business community's concerns. ""One of the key attributes of Hong Kong is that you can go onto Google, you can go onto Facebook and any other platform you want versus what you can do in mainland China,"" she told Bloomberg Television. ""So I do think it's important for the government to recognise that and to be open and say we're going to maintain that free flow of information."" On Friday, the United States issued a rare advisory, warning businesses of the ""growing risks"" of operating in Hong Kong as China clamps down there. The advisory highlighted concerns about data privacy, transparency and access to critical business information, as well as the risk of breaching US sanctions against Chinese officials and entities. ""It's unusual for the US government to put out a business advisory, so something like that has shaken awake anyone who wasn't aware of the changes or the new normal that we're experiencing in Hong Kong,"" Joseph said. Businesses in Hong Kong were adapting to legal and political changes in the city, she added. In a flurry of statements over the weekend, China and Hong Kong's governments lambasted the US advisory and dismissed concerns that the city was losing its competitive edge. The Liaison Office, which represents the central government in Hong Kong, vowed that Beijing would deal a ""head-on blow"" to Washington in response to the warning and the sanctions on seven more Chinese officials. Joseph said most businesses still felt the city was a good place to be. But the national security crackdown was ushering in new changes. ""You have to separate whether the national security law is tapping away at any other aspect of law that would affect companies, such as commercial law,"" she said. ""There's nothing obvious there right now. But it starts to set people questioning those things."" – AFP TERTIARY education is a means towards achieving one’s future goals and aspirations.

"Bougainvillea shrubs provide a refreshing sight along Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah in Kuala Lumpur. — Photos: FAIHAN GHANI/The Star THOUSANDS of bougainvillea shrubs that were planted along various roads in and around Kuala Lumpur in January, have started blooming and are adding pops of colour to the city’s landscape. The varying shades — red, magenta, pink and purple — are beautifying more than 100 locations, including along highways and main roads. A team from Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s (DBKL) Landscape and Recreational Development Department had planted the shrubs following mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah’s pledge to have more trees and plants in line with the city’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. “We planted a variety of species, including bougainvillea which are fast-growing and ever-blooming,’’ said a spokesperson from DBKL’s Corporate Communications Department. “The bougainvillea species planted were the Bougainvillea ‘Elizabeth Angus’, which blooms in a deep purple shade, Bougainvillea ‘Mrs Eva’ in soft pink tones, and Bougainvillea ‘Poultunii’, which has a deep red hue. “It is the best for quick results in a warm climate, and has an incredible array of shades and also requires little maintenance,” the spokesperson added. The areas where the blooms can be seen include Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah (Jalan Ipoh), Jalan Imbi, Jalan Bukit Bintang, Sultan Iskandar Highway (Mahameru Highway) and Jalan Ampang. Ahmad Firdaus, 27, an e-hailing driver, said he only noticed the bright blooms recently when he stopped to take shelter during a thunderstorm near Jalan Ipoh. “I never noticed them before, probably because I was always rushing,” he said. Rahimah Rahmat, a secretary, said she spotted the flowers while at the Malaysia International Trade and Exhibition Centre (Mitec) on Jalan Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah. “I was at the vaccination centre there and saw the bougainvillea blooms, very pretty and refreshing,” she said. In January, Mahadi told StarMetro that DBKL would be adding more greenery to beautify the city and reduce its carbon footprint. “We will be planting more trees and flowering shrubs this time around as they are not just pretty to look at but also environmentally friendly,’’ he said. Mahadi had reiterated DBKL’s commitment in tackling climate change and pushing for Kuala Lumpur to become a low-carbon city. DBKL established a task force last year to work towards achieving the goals under the Kuala Lumpur Low-Carbon Society Blueprint 2030.

"Approximately 65% of misinformation about the vaccine that’s spread on social media can be traced back to 12 people, says the Center for Countering Digital Hate in a recent report. — dpa When it comes to Covid-19 vaccine misinformation, the voices of few reach many, according to a study. Approximately 65% of misinformation about the vaccine that’s spread on social media can be traced back to 12 people, says the Center for Countering Digital Hate in a recent report. The nonprofit organisation refers to those 12 people as the “disinformation dozen”. “Our sample of anti-vaccine content was shared or posted on Facebook or Twitter a total of 812,000 times between February 1 and March 16 of 2021, with 65% of that sample attributable to the Disinformation Dozen,” the center’s report reads. Included in that “disinformation dozen” is Robert F. Kennedy Jr, as are the husband-and-wife duo Ty and Charlene Bollinger, the Center for Countering Digital Hate [CCDH] says. “While some anti-vaxxers identified by CCDH have been removed from a single platform, comprehensive action has yet to be taken, and most remain active on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter,” the organisation says. The center says “deplatforming repeat offenders” is the best way to stop the misinformation from spreading. Last week, US President Joe Biden criticised the spread of misinformation on social media platforms such as Facebook. A day later, Facebook shared a blog post contending that it takes action against misinformation, saying it has removed 18 million such instances since the pandemic started. “The data shows that 85% of Facebook users in the US have been or want to be vaccinated against Covid-19,” reads Saturday’s blog post. “President Biden’s goal was for 70% of Americans to be vaccinated by July 4. Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed.” US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, meanwhile, spoke out against the spread of false information Sunday during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union. “All of us – including the media, including individuals, health professionals – have a responsibility to share the truth about health, as science dictates,” he said. – dpa TERTIARY education is a means towards achieving one’s future goals and aspirations.

"THE government, through the Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry (Motac), hopes to revive the flagging fortunes of many of Kuala Lumpur’s tourist attractions in line with the National Recovery Plan 2021. Tourism Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri said one of the tourist spots that the ministry had identified was the Kuala Lumpur Butterfly Park (KLBP), which she described as “one of the Federal Capital’s unique attractions.” The world-famous butterfly park has been experiencing a slow death due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The operators say it is tough to run the place without a steady income. Business has dropped. Ticket sales have plummeted. In keeping with Covid-19 restrictions, the park was only open for few months last year, operating only from Friday to Sunday. This year, it was barely operational for one month. “KLBP is one of the leading tourist attractions for families, students, as well as domestic and international tourists,’’ Nancy said. Her assurance is indeed timely as the future of the city’s precious asset is uncertain. KLBP is located on Jalan Cenderasari, Taman Tasik Perdana (Lake Gardens) and is the only butterfly park in Kuala Lumpur. There are concerns that the park may fall prey to corporate predators. According to sources from Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL), the KLBP’s lease tenure was for 20 years, and it expired on Dec 31 last year. Fortunately, the operators had successfully appealed for an extension from DBKL, which ends on Dec 31 this year. “We managed to get approval for another year from DBKL which will end in December,’’ confirmed park director Timothy Tong. But that only gives the park operator another five months. For many of the butterfly park’s lovers, it is quite disheartening to know that this may be the end of the road for the attraction. Many city folk are also concerned that with the expiry of the lease, it would mean that the park could be open to development. Nancy’s assurance has not only given hope to the park operators but to Kuala Lumpur residents as well. “Motac and Tourism Malaysia will support and recommend to DBKL to expedite the butterfly park’s renewal process due to its uniqueness and attraction as an ecotourism product located right in the heart of the city,’’ she said. “Tourism Malaysia will continuously provide relevant information on the park to the public, especially students and institutions on educational tours. She added that she would urge the park’s operators to continue collaborating with schools and learning institutions to organise educational tours from time to time. In previous reports, StarMetro had quoted experts in the field, who warned that Kuala Lumpur was in danger of losing its butterfly population if the city did not take efforts to conserve them. Entomologists had said that DBKL needed to preserve as many green lungs as possible and plant more flowering plants that would attract butterflies. In January, Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mahadi Che Ngah told StarMetro that DBKL was not the landowner of the butterfly park. “The land (butterfly park) belongs to the Federal Lands Commissioner (PTP) and we are subject to the landowners’ future plans,’’ he had said. Mahadi had also said that DBKL was preparing its local plan and consultants were studying the distribution of land use for the entire area, including the park, and would be engaging with stakeholders before it was zoned and gazetted. “It is too early to say anything about it, so I would appreciate if people do not speculate,” he added. StarMetro had contacted former mayor Tan Sri Ahmad Phesal Talib for verification on the parties interested in the land. Now retired, Ahmad Phesal confirmed that there had been a proposal from a developer to develop the land and its surrounding areas. “Yes, there was a proposal but those were just ‘talks’, a redevelopment proposal under the theme Warisan (Heritage), which involved several plots of land in the area, to be developed together with a condo project,’’ he said. He added that the proposal did not go through following objections from various stakeholders, including the police whose headquarters in Bukit Aman would have been affected by the development. KLBP director Timothy Tong said the park has been struggling since Covid-19 movement restrictions came into effect in March last year. Ticket sales have plummeted as 70% of the visitors were foreign tourists. “We have been operational probably only one month this year and it’s been tough as operating costs have been increasing,’’ he lamented. Asked to comment on Nancy’s assurance, Tong said: “Yes it’s good news. It gives us something to look forward to.” The 0.8ha butterfly park was built in 1991 and opened to the public in 1992. Tong took over the management of the park from its previous operator in 1995. The KLBP is the legacy of the late Kuala Lumpur mayor Tan Sri Elyas Omar. Elyas served as the capital city’s third mayor from 1981 to 1992, and was instrumental in introducing the butterfly park, as well as the Kuala Lumpur Orchid Garden and Kuala Lumpur Bird Park.

"Artist’s impression of SIC, which will house three main hubs, including a Regional R&D Hub. — Skymind Skymind Future Cities managing director Eow Wan Lin said the company is currently in discussions with Johor to build Skymind Innovation City (SIC) for creating and testing artificial intelligence-powered technologies at Iskandar Malaysia. “Skymind Innovation City will create a platform for enterprises and industries to develop their own AI applications, and equip them with tools to be innovators in the industry by building a stronger AI ecosystem,” he said in a statement. He explained that SIC will focus on three main hubs: a Talent Hub for developing a skilled workforce in AI, an Innovation Hub for enabling AI innovators and a Regional R&D Hub for research and development of AI applications. Eow sees SIC as the company’s way of supporting Johor’s Digital Agenda and innovation programmes to develop a vibrant ecosystem for growth in the digital space. At the recent virtual World AI Conference Shanghai 2021, Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad said a robust upskilling and reskilling programme will be set up to ensure that the state is on track to become an AI powerhouse. Policies too will be established, he said, to forge partnerships with the private sector and to support innovation in AI. A Special Digital Economic Zone will be developed for companies to research and build smart solutions for manufacturing, he added. Eow said the announcement by Hasni shows support for the innovation economy, which has to be bolstered by government policies, technology and entrepreneurship. “These factors should be the main goal, along with developing effective private-public partnerships that spark increased innovation and productivity,” he said. Nations such as South Korea and Taiwan which have invested a higher percentage of their GDP into innovation performed much better in terms of GDP per capita growth than countries that didn’t, he said, citing a report by The Conversation. “South Korea was badly impacted by the economic slump in 1997. But today it is one of the most successful economies in the world. “It has emerged as the most innovative country in the world, topping the 2021 Bloomberg Innovation Index released in February,” he said. The country’s achievement is largely attributed to the commitment of South Korean businesses and the authorities in investing in the country’s future growth even when encountering tough headwinds at home and abroad, said Eow. Malaysia currently ranks eighth in Asia and 33rd in the world in the Global Innovation Index 2020, he said, adding that it has the potential to improve by tapping into the AI revolution. “Capital or investment in research and development will ensure that the country produces better products and services, and introduces new ones,” he said. He shared that Skymind’s mission is to enable and empower the development of AI applications in Malaysia with tools, support systems and investments. “To remain competitive in a world on the cusp of super connectivity, it’s crucial that Malaysia accelerates its capacity for innovation,” he said. He quoted the Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting The AI Revolution report by PwC, which predicted that AI will contribute US$15.7 trillion (RM65.9 trillion) to the global GDP by 2030. “In short, the impact of AI over the next decade will be monumental. It is imperative that Malaysia jumps onto the bandwagon,” he said. And the establishment of “innovation cities” would have a multiplier effect that would give AI companies greater reach into the region, said Eow, adding that Skymind wants to help Malaysia grow into an “AI nation”.

"Telegram said it acknowledged the vulerabilities highlighted by the researchers and fixed them in its latest update. — Zuma Press/TNS A group of researchers from London have found critical vulnerabilities in popular messaging app Telegram, which is used by over 500 million users across the world. The researchers comprising those from Royal Holloway, University of London, analysed the encryption protocols used by Telegram and highlighted the vulnerabilities in its cloud chats. Telegram said it acknowledged the vulerabilities highlighted by the researchers and fixed them in its latest update. The platform uses MTProto protocol to secure its cloud chats, something like the Transport Layer Security (TLS), a popular cryptographic standard meant to ensure security of data in transit. Explaining what they set out the achieve, the researchers said in their study that they launched four attacks on the security protocols used by the popular messaging app and the last one “broke the authentication properties of Telegram's key exchange, allowing a MitM attack”. “Telegram uses its MTProto ‘record layer’ – offering protection based on symmetric cryptographic techniques – for two different types of chats. By default, messages are encrypted and authenticated between a client and a server, but not end-to-end encrypted: such chats are referred to as cloud chats,” said the study. They said though the platform offers end-to-end encryption (E2EE) through a feature called “secret chats”, the cloud chats aren’t encrypted. They then described the methods used to attack Telegram’s security protocol and how they succeeded. The vulnerabilities gave an adversary the chance to “reorder” messages, said researchers, adding that it can allow the hackers to manipulate Telegram bots. The messaging app uses cloud chats to control several automated bots. “The latest versions of official Telegram apps already contain the changes that make the four observations made by the researchers no longer relevant,” Telegram wrote in a blog post on Friday.  have seen massive surge in downloads and usage after WhatsApp updated its privacy policy that included a controversial change of linking data of WhatsApp users to Facebook’s other products and services. – The Hindustan Times, New Delhi/Tribune News Service TERTIARY education is a means towards achieving one’s future goals and aspirations.

"RESIDENTS in Kuala Lumpur who were recently under the enhanced movement control order are taking measures to ensure another lockdown does not happen in their areas. In Sentul, Kampung Padang Balang residents are slowly adjusting to life after they were placed under a two-week enhanced MCO. Residents Association chairman Mohd Amir Fisal said they would be focusing on more preventive measures to tackle Covid-19 in the community. “It is most important to provide accredited information about the virus and vaccinations to our residents. “Once they truly understand what needs to be done, it will be easier to put into practice. “This would include messages such as the importance of maintaining physical distancing even with neighbours. “We have also advised them to not go out of the village unless for emergencies or important work.” He added that they were also encouraging residents, especially seniors, to take up activities that would keep their minds active. “Many of our seniors are stuck at home worrying about their children and grandchildren and this is affecting their health. “So we give them ideas to keep themselves occupied within the safety of their homes, such as planting fruits and vegetables.” He said they were also providing help to residents who were still under home quarantine. “Out of some 600 residents tested, more than 68 were positive. “Luckily, most of them were under category one and were self isolating at home,” he said, adding that there were about 12,000 residents spread over an 80ha area. He said it was important to realise that the threat of the virus was real and they should not let their guard down. Kampung Padang Balang was placed under enhanced MCO from July 3 to16. In Setapak, the Desa Rejang Public Housing community is focused on ensuring that they maintain cleanliness of the area after the enhanced MCO was lifted at the flats on July 1. Desa Rejang Public Housing Residents Association chairman Mohd Noor Md Tahir said they also wanted to make sure that each block was frequently cleaned and sanitised. “We advise residents who are symptomatic to get tested and be updated should there be any outbreak. “We also regularly inform residents to avoid gatherings so that the virus does not spread within the community. “The enhanced MCO should be seen as a learning experience and we should take steps to ensure that we are not placed under such circumstances again,” he said. The flats were under enhanced MCO from June 18 to July 1 after 264 residents tested positive. TERTIARY education is a means towards achieving one’s future goals and aspirations.

"FILE PHOTO: Josh Giegel, co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop, walks next to a hyperloop tube at the company's hyperloop facility near Las Vegas, Nevada, May 5, 2021. REUTERS/Mike Blake NEW YORK (Reuters) -     Think about the future of transportation, and you might envision the old animated show ""The Jetsons,"" with everyone flying around in personal spaceships. Not only did that never happen, but we are still piling into creaky old subways and buses. Josh Giegel wants to start from scratch. The chief executive and co-founder of Virgin Hyperloop foresees us zipping between cities in minutes, a future not as far off as you may think. Giegel sat down with Reuters to talk about how this budding technology could change the way we live and work. Q: Humanity is facing all sorts of transportation challenges, so why do you think hyperloop is the right solution? A: We're looking at moving massive amounts of people, at the speed of an aircraft, giving them the opportunity to live where they want to live and work where they want to work. A hyperloop would move as many people and goods as a 30-lane highway. A: We take you inside a tube, which gives you lots of advantages. It's impervious to weather, and you avoid lots of things that cause accidents, like crossings.  Inside the tube we take almost all the air out, allowing you to go at high speeds with very little energy consumption. We use magnetic levitation technology, so there is no grinding, and everything is contactless and smooth. With electromagnetic propulsion, and 20-30 passengers per pod, we could move tens of thousands of passengers per hour. Q: You actually rode in one at your Nevada test facility, so what was it like? A: From starting this in a garage seven years ago, to drawing it up on a whiteboard, to sitting inside it, it was all very surreal. The acceleration was similar to a sportscar, and we were giddy. The biggest piece of that test was that the world saw two people get on a hyperloop, and saw two people get off.  Until that moment, everyone wondered ""Could it be safe for people?"" Now we know that it is. A: It transforms the math. Look at how long it takes you right now to get across Manhattan. Maybe 40 minutes. You could go from NYC to Washington, D.C., in less time. You could go from LA to Las Vegas in 40 minutes.  What we're doing is similar to what Roman roads, and Spanish ships, and airplanes did – shrinking the time associated with distance. Q: What is the timeline to have it up and running? A: This is not 10 or 20 years away. Cities can start incorporating this into their planning right now.  I couldn't put my finger on who will be the very first, but in addition to America, we are also looking at places like India, Europe and the Middle East. We are probably looking at a timeframe of 2025-27. Q: Since you are a Virgin company, what has your interaction with Sir Richard Branson been like? A: He is a consummate dreamer who believes in what we are trying to do. What I enjoy about Richard is that he not only started his own business from nothing, but he's an adventurer. We are not only building a new type of transportation system, but we are trying to attract passengers to something new – and that's what he has done, from Virgin Atlantic to Virgin Cruises to Virgin Galactic. He knows how to build customer acceptance and loyalty. Q: If this tech catches on, will it change how people live and work? A: One hundred percent. I have a two-year-old son, and the way he will be able to live is unlike anything we can imagine. If you look at the cities of the future, people might want to live in one area, and work in other areas. We're already seeing that with the pandemic. My dream is to live near Yosemite and then work with my team in LA. A hyperloop would give you the potential to do both. Q: What do you want people to know about this technology? A: Big ideas don't have to take long periods of time. You can go from a garage to a moonshot idea in a couple of years. This decade could end with hundreds of millions of people riding hyperloop. For people who think this technology is many years away, I rode on one. It's right now.

"Taxi and e-hailing drivers face risk of contracting Covid-19 due to the nature of their work. — Filepic LAST week, my regular taxi driver Satkunaseelan Chelladurai succumbed to Covid-19. Neither Seelan, as he was fondly known as, nor his family had suspected that he was infected, having exhibited none of the symptoms synonymous with the virus. Seelan merely experienced fatigue, which was understandable for a 68-year-old man who had been putting in long hours to make ends meet, given the drastic decrease in passengers in recent times. On June 28, he was supposed to drive me to Setia Convention Centre in Shah Alam for an assignment but called to cancel the trip, saying his legs had buckled and that he was feeling very sick. When rushed to a nearby clinic by his family, it was discovered that Seelan had Covid-19 and he was immediately transferred to Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah, Klang (HTAR) in an ambulance. A couple of days later, he was intubated and put in an induced coma, from which he never emerged. Luckily, all his family members subsequently tested negative for Covid-19. The Klang-based Seelan was a very chatty and likeable person, and had many regular passengers. I first took his taxi 14 years ago and we became fast friends. Besides driving me around whenever required, he also helped the animal rescue organisation that I am a part of — Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better (MDDB) — by picking up and delivering veterinary prescriptions and groceries. He would even collect medication from the Gasing Veterinary Hospital for my two senior dogs for their heart and liver problems, respectively. It was also Seelan who helped me renew my driving licence last year. To me, he was like a brother from another mother. I will miss him tremendously and am saddened that such a tragedy had to befall him and his family. While we had no information on where Seelan might have caught the Covid-19 virus from, it would be undeniable that he and other taxi drivers faced the risk due to the nature of their job. This drives home the need for taxi, e-hailing and bus drivers as well as p-hailing riders — whose job leaves them exposed to the virus daily — to be vaccinated as soon as possible. During the Transportation Sector Vaccination Programme for seafarers and port workers in Port Klang on June 25, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong said his ministry and the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force were coordinating the vaccination of some 355,064 taxi, e-hailing and bus drivers as well as p-hailing riders. Dr Wee had added that the exercise would be carried out at the vaccination centres, and that the government would fully bear the cost. Currently, public transport service providers are at great risk of contracting Covid-19 in Klang, which has transformed from being a haven for foodies and history lovers into a hotspot for Covid-19 infections. The long queues at the district’s Covid-19 assessment centres and the massive numbers of patients at HTAR, not to mention the bodies piling up at its mortuary, speak volumes of how this dastardly virus has grabbed Klang by the throat. As for my dear departed friend Seelan: Rest in peace, brother.

"The bullock cart sculpture in George Town with a coin as its wheel, referring to an old saying that a 10sen coin is the size of a bullock cart wheel to islanders. – CHAN BOON KAI/The Star MANY of my friends who are businessmen in the Klang Valley have a rule about Penang. “Don’t do business with Penangites,” they would tell me during my seven years in the Klang Valley in the early 2000s. They did not know I love Penang as I listened to them with a poker face. No fewer than seven seasoned entrepreneurs -- in food and beverage, construction, information technology, et cetera -- swore they would never do joint ventures with Penang business folk. And I met several business contacts in Ipoh with the same perception. Penangites are stingy, petty and calculative, they would say. And then there was something a professor at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) told me once. According to her, when she was a student at USM, young ladies studying there would pass this advice around: Do not date Penangites; they take you only to hawker stalls. Arching over all these allegations is the oft-spoken sentence: “A 10sen coin is the size of a bullock cart wheel in Penang”, meaning to say Penangites make a big deal over 10 sen. It seems some Penangites take pride in this label because there is a sculpture in Jalan Masjid Kapitan Kling, George Town, to illustrate it. It is an iron piece of a bullock cart with the square half-cent coin of the Straits Settlement days used as its wheel. “That statement was once said by Penangites on the mainland about those on the island,” said former Jelutong MP Jeff Ooi. Ooi, 65, a Kedahan, spent a good deal of his youth on mainland Penang. He was an IT consultant in the Klang Valley for many years and then spent two terms serving Penang as an MP. He recalls that when this bullock cart wheel saying reached the Klang Valley, folk there modified it to say that the 10 sen coin was the size of a roundabout for Penang folk. “This saying has been around for as long as I can remember and it was first spoken about the islanders,” said Ooi. “Maybe Penangites of old were so careful with their money that it became a culture of sorts. “I myself view Penang folk as having extra tight purse strings but I see this as a trait only among those in their 50s and above. “Younger Penangites who have spent time working around Kuala Lumpur know they shouldn’t be counting pennies all the time.” I began ruminating about this bullock cart wheel saying because of the Penang ferries. Our grand old ferries are heading for a new future as floating restaurants, museums and tourist attractions, showing how much they mean to Penangites and visitors. Then on social media, I read posts from Penangites expressing hope that these new attractions would be “affordable”. Why should they be affordable? Why can’t they be wonderful, flashy, enriching and posh? Grand, well-designed and beautiful? In the 1950s, there was a project management principle called the Iron Triangle, also called the Triple Constraint. It states that the success or end-quality of a project is limited by cost, time and scope. The Iron Triangle is now deemed obsolete because it cannot weigh in other facets of successful project management such as stakeholder values and environmental sustainability, but as a rule of thumb, the three constraints are today encapsulated into three adjectives: good, fast and cheap. What is good and fast cannot be cheap. What is fast and cheap will never be good. And if you want it good and cheap, don’t expect it to be fast. However you do it, you cannot get it good and fast and cheap at the same time. If we want the new future of the ferries to be affordable (cheap?), we get to pick one more. Do we want it good or fast? We need to rely on the abilities of entrepreneurs to give the new ferries a bright future. The projects need to be rewarding for them, their employees and financiers to attract good talent and resources. We need to make sure that what the ferries become will not be laughed at, made fun of, criticised. So let’s not ask for “affordable”. Let us be willing to pay well and expect a good time on the ferries when they are reborn.

"China has been tightening regulations on tech companies, in parallel with concerned about inequality, with President Xi Jinping recently saying ""common prosperity” should be the ultimate goal. – Xinhua via AP China’s tech tycoons are discovering their charitable side as they come under mounting regulatory scrutiny from Beijing. In the latest example, Xiaomi Corp. co-founder Lei Jun handed over US$2.2bill (RM9.28bil) of shares in the smartphone maker to two foundations, according to filings to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. That came after Meituan’s Wang Xing and ByteDance Ltd.’s Zhang Yiming gave away parts of their fortune to charitable causes last month. The moves come as a crackdown on technology companies has intensified since November, when Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. was forced to pull its giant initial public offering. It’s a new era for the country’s billionaires as China tightens regulations in areas from financial services and internet platforms to data security and overseas listings. At the same time, the Chinese public is becoming increasingly concerned about inequality. In a speech in October, President Xi Jinping said the country’s development was ""unbalanced” and ""common prosperity” should be the ultimate goal. ""It’s likely much more than coincidence that China’s tech billionaires have begun to evince a strong charitable urge,” said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital. ""It could stem from deep patriotic feelings or Buddhist inclinations, but it appears to be strongly correlated to Beijing’s recent regulatory crackdowns.” In June, Meituan founder Wang donated a US$2.3bil (RM9.7bil) stake in the food delivery giant to his own philanthropic foundation. That came after China’s antitrust watchdog announced an investigation into the company, and the billionaire posted a classical poem online that some saw as a veiled criticism of Beijing. That same month, ByteDance founder Zhang, China’s fourth-richest person with a net worth of US$44.5bil (RM187.64bil), gave about US$77mil (RM324.68mil) of his own wealth to an education fund in his hometown. And in April, Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Pony Ma, the second-richest with US$56.7bil (RM239.08bil), pledged to set aside US$7.7bil (RM32.47bil) of the company’s money toward curing societal ills and lifting China’s countryside out of poverty. – Bloomberg TRUE wireless stereo (TWS) noise-cancelling earbuds come in handy when you want to escape the intrusion of the outside world, block out the distracting sounds of daily life or devote yourself to work without interruption. ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"The first drive-through vaccination kiosk at Stadium Indera Mulia, Ipoh is effective.­ — Filepic AS A member of the media and a frontliner, I count myself fortunate to have completed my Covid-19 vaccination. But for the majority of Perak folk, including some of my family members and extended kin, it is still a waiting game. To many Perakians, the national immunisation programme, which is in its second phase, seems to be moving slowly. Since it started in April, only about 16% of the adult population in the state have had their first jab. According to statistics, 303,493 people had received their first dose as of June 26. On June 29, the figure rose to 313,917, which means only 10,424 people were vaccinated over 72 hours. This averages out to about 3,474 people daily, which is a far cry from Perak Mentri Besar Datuk Saarani Mohamad’s target to achieve 15,000 jabs each day in June. To put it into perspective, there are about 1.87 million adults in Perak, and the number of people in the state who have registered is about 1.18 million or 63% of the total adult population. There are a few issues believed to be hampering the progress of vaccinations. They include people who have missed their appointments, fear of side effects and lack of transportation. Another issue faced by some is getting vaccination appointments at far-away locations. Just recently, I received a complaint from a hardware shop owner in Lenggong that he and his wife were notified to get their vaccination in Pengkalan Hulu. The 61-year-old man was scheduled to get his jab on June 29 and his wife, the following day. The distance between Lenggong and Pengkalan Hulu is about 97km and it takes about an hour-and-a-half to drive there. This means a round trip will take an estimated three hours. Fortunately, the shopowner and his wife were able to change the vaccination location to a centre in Lenggong. Other incidents included a Sitiawan native who was asked to fly to Kuching, Sarawak for the jab, while a lawyer from Ipoh was told to go to Port Dickson, Negri Sembilan. Some people may feel vexed by the need to travel long distances and decide to forego their appointment. Not everyone is savvy enough to know what to do in such a situation. So the government should make it easier for everyone, especially senior folk, to get their vaccination. Convenience is the key word here, whereby more must be done to facilitate and enable easy access to the vaccine. Local state representatives too, must play their part in disseminating information to their constituents on what to do if they have a problem, or better still — help them resolve it. Perak has started several initiatives to ramp up the vaccination rate, which includes having a drive-through kiosk at Stadium Indera Mulia that began operating last month. Mobile vaccination services are also being deployed to dispense jabs at Orang Asli villages and old folks homes, while transportation services are available to ferry people to the vaccination centres. Several private hospitals, clinics and medical practitioners also joined the vaccination programme to help administer the vaccine. There should be more mobile vaccination teams to reach out to those in smaller towns and rural areas. Each district in the state should have at least two to three teams, depending on its population, to speed up the vaccination rate. With the emergence of the more easily transmittable coronavirus variants, the clock is truly ticking for all of us. For the time being, people just have to stay safe and wait patiently until they get called up for the jab.

"Good and experienced tech workers are being treated like local celebrities – hounded by recruiters, courted by managers, and bestowed a bevy of options before choosing their next boss. — The San Diego Union-Tribune/TNS There’s an air of desperation among tech employers this summer. Software talent, it seems, is in such high demand that companies are morphing how they hire. And workers are the ones with the power. Good and experienced tech workers are being treated like local celebrities – hounded by recruiters, courted by managers, and bestowed a bevy of options before choosing their next boss. “It makes you feel like you’re amazing, when really... you’re just another software engineer that’s looking for a job,” said Henry Chesnutt, who just moved back to San Diego from San Francisco to work at the rapidly growing tech startup Flock Freight. The job outlook for workers like Chesnutt has been good for much of the past decade. But now, a multitude of factors is driving competition for talent to a level not seen in nearly 20 years, some recruiters say. “This is the most competitive market I can remember in my professional career, with many people comparing it to the dot-com market of the late ‘90s,” said Jim Bartolomea, vice president of Global Talent at tech titan ServiceNow, which employs a huge chunk of the software talent in San Diego. Last month, employers posted more than 365,000 job openings for IT workers, the highest monthly total since September 2019, according to IT trade group CompTIA. The positions highest in demand include software developers, IT support specialists, systems engineers and architects. The demand has been attributed to all sorts of things. During the pandemic, businesses that had been slow to adopt enterprise software began rapidly catching up. A tidal wave of productivity software, conferencing and collaboration tools, and e-commerce tech flooded the world. The same was true for consumer tech, with video game development, entertainment tech and social platforms booming. Many of these jobs are going unfilled, as competition for new hires ramps up. Simultaneously, remote work became the status quo in the tech industry. Suddenly, software talent could pick and choose from a massive pool of job opportunities. All while existing talent is beginning to stray. Roughly a third of more than 2,800 IT professionals said they plan to look for a new job in the next few months, according to a recent Robert Half International survey. Aaron Bartholomew, a lead backend developer at tech company Trust & Will, just went through a two-month job search in which he held the power in the employer-worker exchange. “I realised pretty quick that I was the one with the upper hand,” Bartholomew said. “All these companies were moving incredibly fast to try and close on me.” Software interviews have a reputation for being slow, painful processes that involve tests of logic, design and computer science knowledge. Years ago, Chesnutt was tested for five straight hours on algorithms during an interview with YouTube. But now, these technical interviews are often being waived, said Chesnutt and Bartholomew, who both experienced this step dropped for the sake of urgency. Recruiters are increasingly using what Chesnutt sees as pressure tactics, such as “exploding offers”, which are job offers that self-detonate at a set date and time if engineers don’t accept it soon enough. “They’ll try to rush you through the process as soon as possible, and get you to sign that day while they’re on the phone with you,” Chesnutt said. Brett Wayne, a tech recruiter and managing director at Cypress, said the competitive pressure is unlike anything he’s seen in his 13-year career in recruiting. He likened it to what’s happening in the real estate market. Just like a hot property with multiple bids, Chesnutt ended his job hunt with four employment offers. To win a bid on a quality engineer, companies are offering things like flexible hours, sign-on bonuses, and permanent remote work, the last of which has become a requirement for much of the workforce. Dice, a website and staffing firm that focuses on tech talent, published a report in June that found only 17% of technologists wanted to work in an office full time, while 59% wanted remote and hybrid approaches. Wayne said he’s observed companies shoot themselves in the foot by not offering remote options, making an already slim candidate pool even slimmer. “If it was hard to hire talent 18 months ago – and now you cut the group you’re going for in half – it’s going to be really tough for you,” Wayne said. Bartholomew said he’s watched a great migration of developers out of urban areas, riding remote work out of San Diego or other cities. “Literally about 50% of my peer group has moved,” Bartholomew said. “Companies that adapt will get the majority of the talent pool.” It’s not strict remote work, however, that seems to be appealing to the majority of engineers, according to the Dice report. It’s more about flexibility to choose. “While many technologists would still prefer to work 100% remotely, there is an equal desire for a hybrid approach, and we’ve actually seen fewer remote days per week become more desirable over the past year,” said Art Zeile, CEO of Dice, in a statement. “The companies who succeed in attracting and retaining top talent will be those who take the time to build an agile approach that gives technologists flexibility and control over their work environment.” US tech salaries are also on the rise. A recent Dice report found tech jobs saw an average salary increase of 3.6% between late 2019 and late 2020. That might not sound like much, but it’s a significant jump when compared to 2017, 2018 and 2019, which saw an annual increase of less than 1%. US employers across all industries – not just tech – reported their strongest hiring outlook since 2000, according to an employment outlook survey published by staffing giant ManpowerGroup in June. “It’s a worker’s market and employees are acting like consumers in how they are consuming work – seeking flexibility, competitive pay and fast decisions,” said Becky Frankiewicz, ManpowerGroup president, North America, in a statement. “Now is the time for employers to get creative to attract talent – and to hold onto the workers they have with both hands.” – The San Diego Union-Tribune/Tribune News Service TRUE wireless stereo (TWS) noise-cancelling earbuds come in handy when you want to escape the intrusion of the outside world, block out the distracting sounds of daily life or devote yourself to work without interruption. ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"Vaccinated or not, Malaysians must continue to diligently wear face masks and adhere to SOP. — Filepic EVERYWHERE I went over the past week, I heard people talking about the Covid-19 vaccination. As I left my house to buy groceries on Monday, I overheard the next-door aunty talking animatedly about the Pfizer-BioNTech shot she received two weeks ago. Another neighbour told my mum proudly the next day about her daughter who had got her first AstraZeneca jab a week before. My mother, too, received her first shot of the Sinovac vaccine on Wednesday at Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. It took some convincing but she finally registered for vaccination early this month, after several of her friends posted their post-vaccination photos on social media. She was convinced after I received my first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine under the priority programme for media practitioners on June 16. In several WhatsApp groups I belong to, the Covid-19 vaccination topic is all the rage. One friend pointed out how it was like sports day in school, where students are divided into colour-themed sports houses, except this time it was on the brand of vaccine. On social media, photos of people holding placards saying “I have been vaccinated” continue to dominate my feed. It appears that the initial hesitancy among people about getting vaccinated is fast fading, although there are still some who remain sceptical. A more personal touch from loved ones, relatives and friends who have been vaccinated, is probably the best way to get the sceptics on board and even convert anti-vaxxers. Those who are lucky to have received their shots should share their experience with others, and tell everyone it is okay to be vaccinated. Hearing about the experience from trusted faces can be the key to convincing sceptics to sign up for vaccination. Economists have warned that the speed of economic recovery hinges on the success of the immunisation programme, which determines how soon we can reopen the economy. It is therefore crucial that we get as many of our fellow countrymen to be protected against this virus as soon as possible. A sense of hope is rippling across the community that normality will return soon and things will go back to how it was before Covid-19 dominated the headlines. My mum is already planning a family holiday once interstate travel restrictions are eased. A good friend is checking out flight tickets and hotels to several destinations, and is estimating how much she will need to spend once restrictions are lifted. While the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme is clearly gathering steam, it is still too soon to celebrate. A sizeable number of people are still not vaccinated and many await their second shot. Many health experts have warned that it takes about two weeks after the second dose for the vaccination to be effective against Covid-19. This is because it takes time for immunity to build up and the first dose only provides partial protection. Adding to the list of concerns is the spread of the more virulent Delta variant and how effective existing vaccines are against it. As cliched as this advice may sound, it cannot be emphasised enough that adherence to proper health protocols and the standard operating procedure still matters. This means that a face mask is still a must-have item and we need to maintain a safe distance from each other when in public spaces. While recovery is in sight, we must not be lulled into a false sense of security and we must not stop being cautious in the midst of this invisible and deadly virus. The day will come when we can joke about whether we are TeamSinovac, TeamPfizer, TeamAZ or even TeamCanSino and TeamJohnson&Johnson. Until then, we must endure the bumpy ride with optimism.

"Amazon is not only using robotic technology in its warehouses but making machines the boss – hiring, tracking and firing workers with little to no human oversight. — 123rf.com For years we’ve worried about robots taking our jobs, but it turns out they can simply fire us from our jobs. Stephen Normandin, of Phoenix, was one of those hard-working delivery drivers we’ve all become accustomed to, racing around to deliver our Amazon orders – often on the same day or the day after the items were ordered. The Amazon contract driver by all accounts had the kind of work ethic all would admire. He’s an old-school kind of guy who gives his all. But Normandin was summarily fired recently by a machine, which simply sent him an automated email that said he was done. In their boundless search for efficiency, Amazon has high-tech machines that track employees’ speed and automatically cuts them loose if workers don’t live up to the pre-programmed algorithms. Normandin had no human being to appeal to, no one to tell that the reason he didn’t always meet the unreasonable standards for delivery times was because apartment complexes were locked up because of the pandemic, slowing the process of getting inside to deliver packages. Like most changes in life – like chronic aches and pains – the advent of cyborg-type technology is a gradual thing we barely notice. Amazon is speeding up the process, not only using robotic technology in its warehouses but making machines the boss – hiring, tracking and firing workers with little to no human oversight. While robots and robotic-like technology have grown dramatically, particularly in factories, experts say the expectation that robots would be roaming everywhere has not come to pass as quickly as expected. That has, in a sense, been a bit of a letdown as we’ve spent the past decades watching movies and reading books about how human-like robots would soon be interacting with us in day-to-day life. Part of the problem has been that getting robots to learn new things on their own and have intrinsic safety built in has been a bigger challenge than many thought. But with a lot of smart people working on it, robotic technology will keep improving. Still, it appears there will be many things robots will never be able to master. No matter how advanced they become, we can take solace in knowing robotic machines will never be able to get our jokes. Siri and Alexa can mine millions of jokes from the Internet and repeat them to us, but they’ll never understand them. Linguists say that’s because our complex creative language, especially humour, is impossible for artificial intelligence to learn and comprehend. Even when robotic machines are fed a lot of creative language, they completely miss context, a core element of humour. So a robot may be able to walk into a bar, but it won’t be able to do comedy. Amazon has bet on the premise that machines, properly programmed, can make decisions more accurately and quickly than humans can. But while robots can be programmed to perform most tasks and follow algorithms, they can’t feel the kind of true emotions we do – like whether a 63-year-old Army veteran who busted his tail delivering Amazon packages should maybe be kept on the job. – The Free Press, Mankato, Minnesota/Tribune News Service TERTIARY education is a means towards achieving one’s future goals and aspirations.

"Getting vaccinated is far easier than having to chase a mongoose in the hopes of finding an elusive plant that may hold a cure for Covid-19. — Photo courtesy of Creative Commons ALL of us are getting an overdose of vaccine news these days. The Malaysian style of greeting each other has changed from asking, “Have you eaten?” to “Have you been vaccinated yet?” Media personnel are now familiar faces at vaccination centres in Penang as we follow politicians who visit the venues and talk hopefully about reaching herd immunity. It still seems like a tall order for Penang to see at least 70% or 1.38 million of the state population vaccinated by August. There is progress, though. I have observed more people getting their first doses over the last couple of weeks. A few of my friends had their jabs already. Some have gotten appointment dates. “Why wait, since the vaccine is free and we may not be able to travel in the future if we are not vaccinated,” said a friend. However, another friend who is a counsellor at a university in Kuala Lumpur, has her doubts. “I will only get vaccinated if forced and even then, only if it is Pfizer. “We are guinea pigs for the vaccines. I am not interested in herd immunity and am definitely not following the herd,” she said. My father, who is 88, has a simple analogy of how one can withstand any virus attack. He was on traditional medication for years and has many books on the subject. One interesting story he told was about a particular herb that he claimed provided immunity against any virus or disease. “Deep in the jungle of India, you need to look for the mongoose and cobra, which are sworn enemies, locked in a duel. “In most cases, the mongoose kills the cobra with a bite on the head but there are times when the cobra bites the mongoose first. “When this happens, the mongoose runs fast to a particular spot where a certain plant grows and will roll in it, nullifying the cobra venom. I was bewildered when he told me this, although my father certainly seems immune to a lot of diseases. How do we know which jungle, exactly? How do you find those two animals in a fight to the death? How do you chase a mongoose through a dense jungle until it finds that particular bush? My father never answered any of those questions. But he did answer my next one. “Why did you give up traditional medicine for your mild diabetes and opt for modern medicine instead?” He said traditional medicine for diabetes only works if one is on a strict diet. My father loves tea and coffee, laced with condensed milk. “I want to eat well and enjoy my food. That is what keeps me strong today. All of you are poor eaters,” added my father. So since he wants to eat to his heart’s content in his sunset years, he duly takes modern medicine to keep his blood sugar in check. I wish to believe my aged father is strong because he grew up at a time when the food and environment were not as contaminated as they are today. My mother, 83, is strong too and she had an aunt who gave birth to 24 children. Now, who among us is going to chase that mongoose to get a plant that is claimed to potentially give immunity against Covid-19? To recap, do you think you need to be vaccinated? Those who have a strong immune system may think it will not make much of a difference whether you are vaccinated or not. However, those who have had their fair share of coughs, colds and flu have better sign up for the vaccine right away.

"According to Facebook, more than 2.4 billion messages featuring emojis are sent on Messenger every day. — AFP Relaxnews Get ready to make some noise! To celebrate World Emoji Day, Facebook is giving a voice – or rather sounds – to some of its emojis. The platform has unveiled Soundmojis – emojis that make sounds – for users to send via Messenger. Emojis are a key part of social networking, especially on Facebook. Thus, to mark World Emoji Day on Saturday, July 17, Mark Zuckerberg’s platform has announced the launch of sound emojis on Messenger. The news comes via the platform’s official blog. These Soundmojis are different from regular emojis because a sound accompanies the image. Users will have access to a library of Soundmojis, which will be updated regularly with new sounds and famous audio clips, said Facebook. Indeed, the platform states that while emojis like the drumroll, clapping and crickets will embody those sounds, users will also be able to have fun with sound clips from TV shows like   movie. Users will even be able to share clips from songs, as shown in the promotional video shared by Facebook. Soundmojis will be accessible in Messenger by clicking on the emoji icon in a conversation. Then select the speaker icon to preview these next-gen emojis before sending them to friends in the conversations. Recently, Facebook has been rolling out all kinds of new features as it seeks to stand out from other social networks. – AFP Relaxnews TERTIARY education is a means towards achieving one’s future goals and aspirations.

"Turns out playing a video game can somehow be extremely exhausting. — 123rf.com Ever since I started working at home, I realised that I needed to stay fit instead of just sitting around playing video game... errr, I meant, working very hard at the computer every day. The logical solution was to get  , Nintendo's bizarre hybrid of video game and fitness/exercise machine, because my brain operates entirely in the context of games. The game was originally released for the Switch back in October 2019 and has been pretty hard to get hold of – possibly owing to the fact that it's one of those rare video games that requires specialised hardware controllers/accessories to play – but fortunately I got my own copy! By 9pm, I had set up the game, inserting one Joy Con into the specialised yoga ring accessory and another into a strap attached to my left thigh, so my physical movements actually got translated into in-game actions. By 9.10pm, I was a dehydrated pile of vaguely man-shaped flesh collapsed on the floor, screaming at the heavens, and questioning all my life decisions that led me to this point. Surprise! Turns out playing a video game can somehow be extremely exhausting! As I was lying on the floor drenched in sweat and regret, I took a moment to appreciate how brave and/or insane Nintendo was to invest in a game that requires such specialised hardware to play, and such strange actions to interact with the game. I mean, this is a video game where – to move my character in the game – I have to jog in place, with the Joy Con on my thigh detecting the motions. To attack enemies, I have to physically exert myself to squeeze or pull the yoga ring, which appears to have a built-in digital force gauge that measures the strength of my actions. (Note: a force gauge or force meter is a mechanism that measures mechanical forces. It does not tell you how many midi-chlorians you have.) Any other video game developer would have made the ""sensible"" decision to only use the standard interactions that all gamers are familiar with. A joystick to move your character around, and buttons to shoot laser beams or whatever. Or if you're playing on a PC, a mouse to move the camera and keyboard keys to trigger special moves. This is, after all, the ""natural"" way that gamers interact with games. Right? Actually, now that I think of it, maybe squeezing a plastic yoga ring to say ""Yes/Confirm/Proceed"" is just as equally artificial and weird as pressing the Enter key on a keyboard or the X key on a PlayStation 4 controller to do the same. It's just that in the latter cases, people have already gotten used to the method of interaction. There's a certain language of actions that we use to interact with our software that's very easy to take for granted: we pinch touchscreens to zoom in and out, we all agree that clicking on the right mouse button should open a context menu, and holding down the power button for more than five seconds should completely switch off a device instead of putting it to sleep. (For an idea of how complex this can get, check out this   from Google's Material Design, which studies the language of gestures on touchscreen devices. A lot of this language which maps the actions that humans perform (clicking buttons, twiddling joysticks, etc) with the interaction that happens in the software (the webpage scrolls, or Mario does a jump) had to be developed over time. Sure, some interactions seem intuitive, like swiping your finger to scroll a webpage on an iPhone, but other interactions had to go through several iterations before it became something users accepted. First person shooters, in particular, went from keyboard-only PC games where the arrow keys controlled movement; to WASD keys to move and mouse to aim; to console games where everyone somehow agrees that the left joystick is for moving, the right joystick is for aiming, and the shoulder buttons are for shooting. (This makes me wonder what'd happen if the language of interaction used in Nintendo's fitness-based games gets adopted as a new standard – we'd lift dumbbells to play/pause videos and perform the crane pose to open the options menu.) If you're a software designer or developer, one thing to keep in mind is that the hardware always informs users on how they should expect to interact with the software you make, and that comes with a lot of inbuilt expectations. So if you're planning on creating a website, game, or other piece of software that'll be used on multiple different platforms or device types, you'll need to fully understand the implicit language of interaction for each platform. If you make one your ""primary"" and expect to easily port your software to the other platforms/devices, you're in for a rude surprise. You know what's haunting my thoughts right now? Next weekend there's a game jam (it's the   game jam, but it'll be over by the time you're reading this) and I'm kinda stressed about making a web-based game that's compatible on both computers (i.e. with keyboards and mouse) and mobile devices/tablets (i.e. anything with a touchscreen). You'd think computers and mobile devices are practically the same because you probably use both regularly to browse the Internet, but, alas, no. Let's say I want to make a web game where you draw lines to match blocks in a puzzle game. On a PC, it's pretty simple to implement the interaction of ""draw a line"" by listening for the action of ""click mouse and move cursor"". On a touchscreen device, the equivalent action of ""tap and move finger"" already means ""scroll the webpage"". Super! Now I have to sort out this conflict of interactions. And what if I make a shooty pew pew game where you hold down the mouse button to charge up a plasma cannon? That won't translate to touchscreen devices either, because the equivalent action – tapping on the screen and holding – actually triggers the default ""right click""/context menu interaction. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that if you're a developer or designer who wants to build good websites or games or whatever, you need to understand the language of software interaction. It isn't easy, and in fact can be quite exhausting. Almost as exhausting as playing a game that uses a yoga ring. Alright, I'll come clean: the reason I wrote this whole dang article was because I needed an excuse to put off exercising with   again. I want to stay healthy, sure, but I don't want to die from exhaustion in the process. And I mean, typing furiously on the keyboard must count as some sort of cardiovascular activity, right...? You know what, I might as well make using computers a formal form of exercise, so check back with me next time as I detail the Twitter Scroll thumb reps and the yoga pose known as Man Lying On Back Watching YouTube On iPad.

"Minecraft Dungeons is a hack-and-slashing, treasure-looting, dungeon-crawling spin-off game in the Minecraft franchise. It’s basically a casual Diablo-like with blocky aesthetics, and it’s perfect for younger gamers and/or gamers who just want a fairly chill experience smashing zombies. — AFP Relaxnews -like with blocky aesthetics, and it’s perfect for younger gamers and/or gamers who just want a fairly chill experience smashing zombies. Available for PC, Xbox, PS4, and Nintendo Switch (which I played). 3.5 out of 5 stars, and it’s a fine game for its £16.74 (RM88) price tag, but an even better game if you and some friends can snag it on a sale to enjoy the multiplayer. ...right, those paragraphs are all that remains of the three drafts of my original   review. I really wanted to write a “proper”, full review, but after completing the story on Normal and having some time to mull over it, I realised there isn’t really much to be said about the game overall... but there is one very interesting game design decision that  First things first, though: I have to admit my feelings about the game kept changing as I played, which kinda explains the multiple drafts. In the first few dungeons of the game, I was pretty underwhelmed by how simple the gameplay was. Move your character with the left control stick (on the Nintendo Switch), and press A to slash at mindless zombie hordes. I practically fell asleep as I went through the motions of the game’s very generic save-the-world storyline. Boring! I was about to give up, but then the mid-game dungeons ramped things up with higher difficulty levels, and things got so interesting I had to revise my opinion (and review). Spiders for example, who had hitherto only been a mild annoyance because they shot webs that rooted me in place, suddenly became A-rank threats when they had suicidally explosive creepers as buddies. (You can, of course, imagine my panic when I realised   creepers were spawning at higher difficulties, as they announced their presence with their nightmarishly familiar s-ss-sss-sssss-BOOOOM!) Instead of mindlessly slashing at zombies, I now had to cleverly utilise the random assortment of tools I had to solve problems. Firework arrows helped clear distant clusters of spiders, while speed-boosting boots helped me avoid getting s-ss-sss-ssssslaughtered by creepers. Fun! Stressful, but fun! At this point I was rewriting my review with a more positive light, and I started to appreciate the depth of the game and – more importantly – I started to fully realise the impact of the equipment design, from the Enchantment system (you customise your weapons and armours by selecting from a random pool of upgrades) to the Artifacts (basically, they’re your “magic spells”). See, here’s the thing: the equipment (weapons, armour, Artifacts/spells) and upgrades you get are random. -like is probably screaming, “well of course, Captain Obvious! Random loot is the whole point of these hack-and-slash dungeon crawlers!”, but hear me out. In  , there are no character classes – who you are, how powerful you are, and what you can do is determined entirely by the stuff you wield. And what you wield is pretty much up to chance. -likes (and many other games with an RPG bent), you choose a character class that determines how you’ll play the game. You want to be a magical glass cannon in  , pick a Wizard. You want to be a slow and tanky steampunk knight in  , pick an Engineer. You make a choice at the start of the game and stick with it all the way to the end. , on the other hand, runs up to you with a random assortment of knick-knacks every hour, throws them at you without much explanation, and screams “good luck!” as it runs away while a mob of creepers comes barrelling towards you. And you know what? It’s really fun! Did you find some wizard robes? Cool! That reduces the cooldown of your Artifacts/spells, so if you can find fast-acting Artifacts and Enchantments that give you bonuses every time you cast a spell, you can create a tricksy spellslinger who blasts zombies from afar. Wait, did you get comfortable with your spellcaster build? Whoops, here’s a new melee weapon with a higher power level than what you’re wielding, which will be useful for the next difficulty level – maybe try playing a berserker now! ’s equipment system encourages you to adapt and try new things, and in a way it combines the best aspects of roguelike game design (i.e. randomness encouraging players to be flexible with the hand they’re dealt) and classic loot-based RPGs (i.e. there’s always a sense of progression and growth). You might think not being to play the way you want might get annoying, but nope. You can, with a bit of time grinding through specific dungeons, farm for equipment for your favourite playstyle. It’s just that   is really, really good at tempting you with trying out new options by always giving you new, more powerful items.  faltered as I went into the last few dungeons. Despite being great at encouraging players to play in different ways throughout the mid-game, the gameplay balance gets wonky towards the end – so you guessed it, I had to change my opinion, and review, once again. Inflicting and surviving ranged attacks becomes such a dominant end-game strategy, it’s absurd. The only legit weapon to wield against the dense end-game mobs is a rapid-fire wide-shot crossbow, and any piece of armour without the arrow-deflecting upgrade is just a fancy suit you’re wearing to your funeral. The variety of gameplay styles suddenly disappeared, like a fancy cobblestone mansion that’s visited by a surprise creeper.  was a bit of a roller coaster ride – from boredom at its slow start, to an excited peak when I discovered I’m changing “character classes” every few dungeons, to mild disappointment when it boiled down to a game of pew pew arrows at the end. But you know what? That’s perfectly fine, because I still enjoyed the ride.   is generally an okay to above-average game, but it has one simple yet interesting bit of game design that impressed me. Making me change the way I play every few dungeons as a matter-of-fact side effect of wanting to be more powerful, that’s a small bit of design genius. Making me change my mind so many times I had to rewrite this article thrice, though, that just s-ss-sss-sssssucks. TERTIARY education is a means towards achieving one’s future goals and aspirations.

"FILE PHOTO: Relatives cremate the bodies of persons who died due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at a crematorium ground in Giddenahalli village on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, May 2, 2021. REUTERS/Samuel Rajkumar (Reuters) -     India's excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic could be as high as 4.9 million, according to a new study that provides further evidence that millions more may have died from coronavirus than the official tally. The report by the Washington-based Center for Global Development, co-authored by India's former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, included deaths from all causes since the pandemic's start through June 2021.   India has officially reported more than 414,000 deaths due to COVID-19, the third highest tally in the world after the United States and Brazil, but the study adds to growing calls from experts for a rigorous nationwide fatality audit.  A devastating rise in infections in April and May, driven largely by the more infectious and dangerous Delta variant, overwhelmed India's healthcare system and killed at least 170,000 people in May alone, according to official data. ""What is tragically clear is that too many people, in the millions rather than hundreds of thousands, may have died,"" the report said, estimating the excess death toll during the pandemic at between 3.4 million and 4.9 million. The report did not ascribe all the excess deaths to the pandemic. ""We focus on all-cause mortality, and estimate excess mortality relative to a pre-pandemic baseline, adjusting for seasonality,"" it said.  India's health ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.              Some experts have said excess deaths are the best way to measure the real toll from COVID-19. The New York Times said the most conservative estimate of deaths in India was 600,000 and the worst case scenario several times that number. The government has dismissed those figures. Health experts have said the undercounting is largely because of scarce resources in India's vast hinterland where two-thirds of the population lives, and because many have died at home without being tested. India has reported a decline in daily infections from a peak in May, logging its lowest daily count in four months on Tuesday at 30,093 fresh cases.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also been criticised for a messy vaccination campaign that many say contributed to the worsening of the second wave of infections. India has so far only vaccinated just over 8% of eligible adults with the mandatory two doses.

"US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Mark Milley walk to greet US Army General Austin Scott Miller, the former top US commander in Afghanistan, upon his return, at Andrews Air Force Base, US July 14, 2021. - Reuters WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters): US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin will visit South-East Asia later this month, the Pentagon said, a trip that will include stops in the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam, according to the US embassy in Hanoi. ""Secretary Austin's visit will demonstrate the importance the Biden-Harris Administration places on Southeast Asia and on ASEAN as an essential part of the Indo-Pacific's architecture,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations bloc. The U.S. embassy in Hanoi said on Tuesday that Austin's trip would start on July 23. ""This trip will underscore the enduring U.S. commitment to the region, and our interest in upholding the rules-based international order in the region and promoting ASEAN centrality,"" the embassy said in a Facebook post. The United States under President Joe Biden is looking to reinforce the need for a U.S. role in a region where China has sizeable influence as the dominant trade partner, but testy relationships as a result of its military activities in the South China Sea. Austin has been to preserve decades-old military ties with the Philippines, a defense treaty partner, after repeated threats to downgrade the alliance by its largely pro-China President Rodrigo Duterte, whose term ends next year. - Reuters HEALTHCARE as a noble profession has been further accentuated by the pandemic, with doctors and nurses on the frontlines battling Covid-19.

"BUKIT MERTAJAM: Penang police expressed regret over the incident where around 200 foreigners allegedly performed prayers outside a surau in Taman Pelangi on Tuesday morning (July 20).  apologised to all Penangites for failing to detect this incident early. ""We monitored almost all of them and there was a possibility that the SOP monitoring team had moved to another location when the congregation occurred. ""We will study the effectiveness of police in enforcing SOP in Penang,"" he said, referring to a separate probe that will be initiated to check on the effectiveness of enforcement. Comm Shuhaily said those who wish to report on SOP violations can contact the police directly at 04-222 1722. He said the group had allegedly gone to the surau for prayers on the morning of Hari Raya Haji but they were denied entry as the limit of 100 people was reached. They then allegedly proceeded to perform their prayers on a road in front of the surau, which is near the Taman Pelangi flats in Auto City, Juru. ""The surau management had asked them to disperse and locked the gate to prevent further entry. ""As the surau respected the sensitivity of those who wanted to perform prayers and the incident happened spontaneously, it did not inform the police about the numbers outside,” Comm Shuhaily said. He said despite the group practising physical distancing, police will still track them down to facilitate investigation under Section 269 of the Penal Code for a negligent act that could spread an infectious disease as well as movement without permission, Section 270 of the Penal Code for spreading harmful infection and the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 (Act 342) (Measures in Communicable Areas) Regulations 2020. He said no action would be taken against the surau operator as he had complied with SOP. Explaining further, Comm Shuhaily said the neighbourhood comprised about 8,000 people living in 23 blocks of flats of which about 70% of them are foreigners working in nearby factories. The area is just 2.5km away from the Taman Nagasari neighbourhood which was placed under a 14-day enhanced movement control order that ended on July 17. Meanwhile, the Home Ministry assured that firm action without compromise will be taken against any individuals found to be organising the congregation. Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin said the Immigration Department has been ordered to take action. ""Do not be hesitant to take deportation action under the Immigration Act 1958/63 if it involves foreigners. ""While investigations are ongoing, the Home Ministry urged the public to not issue any statement that touches on religious sensitivity and racism that can cause public unrest,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday.

"The Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway is one of the major projects in Cambodia invested by Chinese companies. - The Phnom Penh Post/ANN PHNOM PENH, July 20 (Phnom Penh Post/ANN): China was ranked first in terms of foreign direct investment (FDI) equity inflows to Cambodia in the first half of this year, at about US$2 billion, according to the Chinese ambassador. Speaking in a recent interview with Bayon Television (BTV), Wang Wentian said major projects invested by Chinese companies include the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, a coal-fired power station in Preah Sihanouk province and the Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport. “Practical cooperation in all fields between the two sides has been deepened and played an active role in the Cambodian economy, overcoming the effects of the Covid-19 virus,” he said, stressing that the Chinese side is “pleased to continue to strengthen practical cooperation with Cambodia in all areas to help revive its economy”. Royal Academy of Cambodia economic researcher Hong Vanak pointed out that Chinese FDI stock dipped year-on-year, but represented a greater share of total inflows last year than in 2019. According to the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC), China accounted for 69 per cent of total FDI stock. Vanak told The Post that a good number of projects are pending an injection of funds, or have yet to begin to fully take form. He suggested that investors at other ventures could have just started to look for partners who may be interested in investing in the Kingdom. “We believe that the Chinese investment comes due to the good relations between the Cambodian and Chinese governments. “However, investment is still limited because the investment values are only on paper. The actual disbursements won’t match the [total amount of capital registered], so there’ll be no crisis caused by overwhelming Chinese investment,” he claimed. The Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) was signed by Minister of Commerce Sorasak and his Chinese counterpart Zhong Shan via video link on October 12, with Prime Minister Hun Sen and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi as witnesses. The Cambodian commerce ministry previously said the CCFTA would provide the Kingdom duty-free access to over 300 items. China would grant duty-free status to 95 per cent of agricultural imports from Cambodia, it said. Ministry spokesman Seang Thay told The Post early this month that once the CCFTA is ratified by both countries, Cambodia expects to receive a litany of benefits, such as access to a wider market. He noted, however, that China will accord duty-free status to more imports from Cambodia than the Kingdom will to those from the East Asian economy. Other perks include a freer flow of goods and additional opportunities to attract foreign investment to Cambodia, as well as a shot in the arm for Cambodian agricultural exports to the Chinese market, he said. “This agreement will play a large role in stimulating domestic production, especially in some agricultural segments such as bananas, mangoes, cassava, longan, cashew nuts and so on,” Thay said. Cambodia and China plan to boost bilateral trade to $10 billion by 2023. Bilateral trade between Cambodia and China surged 1.4 per cent last year over 2019, to $9.56 billion, according to the ambassador. And according to the CDC, Cambodia approved 87 new investment projects and expansions of existing ones, worth more than $2.96962 billion. - Phnom Penh Post/ANN HEALTHCARE as a noble profession has been further accentuated by the pandemic, with doctors and nurses on the frontlines battling Covid-19.

"FILE PHOTO: Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures as he arrives to deliver a speech during a session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) in Saint Petersburg, Russia, June 4, 2021. Dmitri Lovetsky/Pool via REUTERS MOSCOW (Reuters) -     Russia is expected to unveil a new Sukhoi fifth-generation stealth fighter jet at an air show near Moscow attended by President Vladimir Putin later on Tuesday.  A brief promotional video released ahead of the MAKS air show featured pilots from UAE, India, Vietnam and Argentina, suggesting that Moscow wants to pitch the plane for export.  Oleg Panteleyev, head of the Aviaport analytical agency, said it would be touted as a rival to the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter.  It is not known when the plane might be ready for serial production. It is unlikely to take to the air when it goes on show. Russia has invested heavily in military aircraft and new armaments under Putin, both for its own armed forces and also to boost export revenue from weapon sales. Many of its new weapons are still based on Soviet-era technology from the Cold War.  Rostec, Russia's state aerospace and defence conglomerate, released photographs of the new plane covered in a protective covering in the run-up to the air show.  In May, an unnamed defence source cited by state news agency RIA said that Rostec was working on a fifth generation light multi-role fighter jet with a single engine.  The aircraft was expected to have a maximum speed of more than twice the speed of sound, to weigh no more than 18 tonnes, and to have reduced radar visibility and high manoeuvrability, that source said. Sergei Chemezov, Rostec's chief, said last December the conglomerate was looking at producing a light single-jet fighter for export.     Russia already has fourth-generation fighter jets - the heavy-class Sukhoi Su-27 and light-class Mikoyan MiG-29. It only has one heavy-class fifth generation fighter jet, the Su-57, but no light-class equivalent, Panteleyev said.  ""Light-class fighter jets are more in demand in the world than heavy-class ones - they are cheaper and more suitable for states that don't have large territories,"" he told Reuters.  In 2011, Russia used the MAKS air show to unveil the Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter.  United Aircraft Corporation, which is part of Rostec, owns the Sukhoi aircraft manufacturer that dates back to the Soviet era.

"A team of government researchers in China have unveiled the design for a commercial nuclear reactor that is expected to be the first in the world that does not need water for cooling, allowing the systems to be built in remote desert regions to provide power for more densely populated areas. The molten salt reactor, which is powered by liquid thorium rather than uranium,  Construction work on the first commercial reactor should be completed by 2030 and the government plans to build several in the deserts and plains of central and western China. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with  , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. China may also consider building these reactors for some countries that have signed up to the   because, unlike uranium, thorium cannot be used to make nuclear weapons. “Small-scale reactors have significant advantages in terms of efficiency, flexibility and economy. They can play a key role in the future transition to clean energy. It is expected that small-scale reactors will be widely deployed in the next few years,” Professor Yan Rui and colleagues at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics wrote in a paper published in the Chinese journal  “A molten salt reactor has the advantage of being multipurpose, small in size and highly flexible. It is as easy to design as a small-scale reactor. In recent years, the potential of small-scale molten salt reactors has caught international attention.” An important drive for the molten salt reactor programme came from President Xi Jinping’s announcement last year that China would become  According to the official plan, reactors in the sparsely populated west of the country will provide a clean, stable electricity supply to the densely populated east in combination with wind and solar power plants. The technology could also provide a new energy source for Chinese warships such as aircraft carriers and submarines. The concept of a reactor powered by liquid salt rather than solid fuel rods has been around since the 1940s, and in the following decade the United States started an experimental programme to build a bomber fuelled by the technology. In the 1960s the US built a facility to test the technology’s capacity to generate electricity, while countries such as France, the former Soviet Union and Japan also launched similar programmes. The idea was attractive because the liquid fuel acts as its own coolant, removing the need for water, while thorium’s lower levels of radioactivity meant there is less risk of nuclear proliferation. These early projects all failed because they could not solve problems such as pipes cracking too easily because they had become corroded by the radioactive molten salt. But scientists learned a lot from these experiments and in recent years researchers in the field have received steady support from the Chinese government. In 2011, Beijing approved the construction of the prototype Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR), in Wuwei, a desert city in Gansu province. Meanwhile, teams of researchers from across the country were mobilised to solve the technical problems that scuppered previous attempts, such as the development of an alloy that can withstand the radiation from thorium salt at temperatures of nearly 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832F). Although the project fell behind schedule last year, in part due to the pandemic, construction work on the TMSR is due to finish next month and a test run of equipment could start as early as September. Although the prototype is only capable of generating two megawatts, if it succeeds it will be the first time the theory has been brought to life. The commercial reactor designed by Yan and his colleagues could generate up to 100MW, less than a uranium reactor but still enough to power a modern residential area with 100,000 inhabitants. Though a power plant needs other equipment such as steam turbines, the reactor itself will only be 3 metres (10 feet) tall and 2.5 metres wide, about the size of a bathroom. It works by allowing the thorium to flow through the reactor, participating in a nuclear chain reaction and transferring the heat to a steam generator outside before returning to the reactor for another cycle. It is safer than traditional nuclear technology because in the event of an accident the molten salt will fall into an underground container. “Due to its high melting point ... the molten salt will quickly cool and solidify without the direct release of solid and liquid effluents, thus preventing the further diffusion of radioactivity into the environment,” the team wrote. Another part of the appeal for China is that it has some of the world’s largest reserves of thorium, a silvery metal with weak radioactivity. By some calculations it has enough to meet the country’s energy needs for at least 20,000 years. In contrast, China has some of the lowest uranium reserves of any nuclear-capable country and even though work on seven or eight new nuclear plants is due to begin within the next few years, there is growing concern in Beijing that shortages could affect the country’s energy security.

"FILE PHOTO: Vials labelled ""Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine"" are seen in this illustration picture taken May 2, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic CHICAGO (Reuters) -     Scientists are working on a benchmark for COVID-19 vaccine efficacy that would allow drugmakers to conduct smaller, speedier human trials to get them to market and address a huge global vaccine shortage. Researchers are trying to determine just what level of COVID-19 antibodies a vaccine must produce to provide protection against the illness. Regulators already use such benchmarks - known as correlates of protection - to evaluate flu vaccines without requiring large, lengthy clinical trials. ""You could use it to predict efficacy from a vaccine, which will be more important as we are less able to conduct placebo-controlled trials,"" said Stanley Plotkin, inventor of the Rubella vaccine and an expert on correlates of protection. ""The information is flowing in,"" he said. ""By the end of this year, I think there will be enough data to convince everyone.""An established benchmark for COVID-19 would allow drugmakers to conduct vaccine trials in just a few thousand people, about one-tenth the size of the studies conducted to gain authorization for currently widely-used coronavirus shots, researchers and drugmakers told Reuters.     Those studies, involving tens of thousands of volunteers,  compared the rate of COVID-19 infections in people who received the shot with the rate in participants who got a placebo.     Such randomized, controlled trials may no longer be considered ethical in some countries, as researchers cannot give a dummy shot to people where an effective vaccine is widely available. In addition, many of the new shots are being developed by small companies that may not be able to conduct very large trials without government funding or a partner with deep pockets.     With an established correlate, drugmakers could test blood samples from a smaller number of trial participants who receive an experimental vaccine to see whether they produced that benchmark level of protective antibodies.  Such a benchmark is “urgently needed” to help overcome  challenges faced by vaccine developers and boost availability of shots, Dr. Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York wrote this month in the journal Nature.    Researchers at Oxford University late last month proposed a potential correlate of protection based on antibodies found in people who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine. The work awaits peer reviewed by other scientists.    Results from a U.S.-backed study of Moderna’s vaccine are expected to be published in a medical journal later this summer. ""We're writing the paper right now,"" said Dr. Peter Gilbert, a biostatistician from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.    Some vaccine experts question whether antibody levels will be a strong enough indicator of protection. Other components of the immune system, such as T-cells and B-cells, are thought to provide important defenses against COVID-19, but are more difficult to measure.  That has been the contention of some top vaccine experts at Pfizer, maker along with BioNTech of one of the most effective COVID-19 vaccines, produced in the largest quantities globally.    It is also possible that each different type of coronavirus  vaccine will require its own correlate, some experts said. Drugmakers working on a new type of vaccine likely would not be able to rely on the correlates based on Moderna’s messenger RNA shot, they say. BRIDGING THE GAP    Meanwhile, vaccine developers are trying to devise acceptable substitutes to huge, placebo-controlled trials. Some aim to show their shot provokes antibody responses at least as good as those seen with currently authorized shots.     European and UK health regulators are working with companies to set standards for these so-called “immunobridging” studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to say whether it would accept such trials for next-generation vaccines. “It doesn't have to be an established correlate of protection, but we have to ... arrive at the right pre-specified criteria, because we cannot risk that a second-generation vaccine ... is of low or modest vaccine efficacy,"" FDA vaccine official Dr. Marion Gruber told fellow regulators at a World Health Organization Meeting in May. ""That would undermine confidence in the vaccine enterprise."" Italy's ReiThera Srl is developing a vaccine using technology similar to AstraZeneca's and will try to demonstrate that its shot is at least as effective. The company has an agreement in principle on trial design with European and British regulators, ReiThera's senior director Stefano Colloca told Reuters. Massive clinical trials are ""no longer ethical and feasible in most countries worldwide,"" he said.    French biotech Valneva and Taiwan's Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp plan to test their vaccines against the AstraZeneca shot, even though both use a different technology. Valneva's trial design was approved by UK regulators. Medigen has a green light from Taiwan. Sanofi, with partner GlaxoSmithKline, and Canada’s Medicago are still opting for placebo-controlled trials involving thousands of participants, including in countries with high infection rates and fewer authorized vaccines available.  NEED FOR BOOSTERS?   The hunt for a correlate is underway from the UK to the United States and Australia. Scientists are comparing antibody levels in vaccinated people who became infected with COVID-19 to those who did not, to find a threshold of protection that made the difference.    Oxford University researchers said work is needed to address correlates for emerging virus variants, such as the highly transmissible Delta that has quickly become dominant globally.  Their proposed antibody model is based on trial volunteers who had mainly contracted the earlier Alpha variant, first identified in the UK.  U.S. government-backed scientists are studying infections in people who received the Moderna vaccine. Moderna spokesman Ray Jordan said the company is also working on the analysis and will publish updates when available.    The correlate benchmark might also indicate when and whether people need vaccine boosters. Pfizer has sought authorization for a third booster dose of its vaccine, citing evidence of waning neutralizing antibody levels. But the company has pushed back against the idea that those same antibodies could be used to predict vaccine efficacy. ""No formal timeline is in place to have correlates of protection established,"" a Pfizer spokesperson said. ""We will continue to work with the scientific community to better understand what immune responses, whether neutralizing antibodies or otherwise, might contribute to protection.”  (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago and Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt; Additional reporting by Emilio Parodi in Milan, Matthias Blamont in Paris, Michael Erman in Maplewood, New Jersey, Allison Martell in Toronto and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Bill Berkrot) ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"A U.S special forces veteran Jason Lilley poses for a portrait at his home in Garden Grove, California, U.S.,  July 9, 2021. Lilley spoke to Reuters about his experience in Afghanistan and his thoughts as the U.S. leaves the country.  Picture taken July 9, 202.   REUTERS/Mike Blake GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (Reuters) -     Jason Lilley was a special operations forces Marine Raider who fought in multiple battles in Iraq and Afghanistan during America's longest war.  As Lilley, 41, reflects on President Joe Biden's decision to end America's military mission in Afghanistan on Aug. 31, he expresses love for his country, but disgust at its politicians and dismay at the blood and money squandered. Comrades were killed and maimed in wars he says were unwinnable, making him rethink his country and his life. ""A hundred percent we lost the war,"" Lilley said. ""The whole point was to get rid of the Taliban and we didn't do that. The Taliban will take over."" Biden says that the Afghan people must decide their own future and that America should not have to sacrifice another generation in an unwinnable war. Al Qaeda's 9/11 attacks on America triggered a nearly 20-year conflict that led to more than 3,500 U.S. and allied military deaths, the deaths of more than 47,000 Afghan civilians, the killing of at least 66,000 Afghan troops, and over 2.7 million Afghans fleeing the county, according to the nonpartisan Costs of War project at Brown University. ""Was it worth it? It's a big a** question,"" said Lilley, who  was on the front lines of America's Global War on Terror in Iraq and Afghanistan for almost 16 years.  He said he deployed believing troops were there to defeat the enemy, stimulate the economy and uplift Afghanistan as a whole. They failed, he said.  ""I don't think one life was worth it on both sides,"" Lilley said as he described his service and his perspective in an interview at his home in Garden Grove, southeast of Los Angeles. Lilley is not alone in reflecting on the U.S. withdrawal after nearly 20 years of war. Many Americans are. The perspectives of Lilley and other veterans can help inform the country about the costs of entering war and the lessons to be learned from Afghanistan. Lilley's opinions are his own and some veterans differ, just as Americans generally have different estimations about a war that improved women's rights and led in 2011 to U.S. Navy SEALS killing al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.  Biden's withdrawal has bipartisan support. A July 12-13 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed only about three in 10 Democrats and four in 10 Republicans believe the military should remain.  Lilley and other Marines who served in Afghanistan and who spoke to Reuters compared it with the conflict in Vietnam. They say both wars had no clear objective, multiple U.S. presidents in charge, and a fierce and non-uniformed enemy. Part of Lilley's support network is Jordan Laird, 34, a former Marine scout sniper who described completing combat tours in Iraq  and Afghanistan, which Laird and others called ""Vietstan.""   ""You have a deeper understanding of the plight of the Vietnam vets who came home with lost limbs and being completely and utterly tossed to one side,"" said Laird, who now campaigns to improve veteran care. He served in Sangin Valley in Helmand Province, one of the most fiercely contested parts of Afghanistan, from October 2010 to April 2011. In his first three months, he said, 25 members of Laird's unit were killed in action and more than 200 were wounded. His best friend bled to death in his arms. While in Afghanistan, Lilley said he grew to understand why historians have called it the ""graveyard of empires."" Britain invaded Afghanistan twice in the 19th century and suffered one of its worst military defeats there in 1842. The Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989, leaving after 15,000 of its troops were killed and tens of thousands were wounded.  Lilley says he was particularly disillusioned by the U.S. military rules of engagement in Afghanistan. He and other units were not allowed to make night raids on the Taliban, for example. ""Marines aren't designed to kiss babies and pass out flyers. We are there to eradicate. We can't do both. So we tried and failed,"" Lilley said. The U.S. Marine Corps referred Reuters to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the military command in charge of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, when asked about Lilley's comment. In an email, CENTCOM had no comment about Lilley's criticisms. A turning point in Lilley's thinking came when a Taliban prisoner told him the Taliban would wait out the United States and knew Americans would lose faith in the war, just as the Soviets did. ""That was 2009. Here we are in 2021, and he was right,"" Lilley said. ""Why did we lose guys? Why?""  Back from the battlefield, Lilley, physically fit and heavily tattooed, said he could not even look at the U.S. flag for several years because he felt so angry that his country had sent him and his colleagues to an unwinnable war. He says he has seen several mental health counselors, but his greatest support network is fellow veterans. Lilley is vice president of the veteran-operated Reel Warrior Foundation, which gives veterans a chance to break from the struggles of re-adapting to civilian life by taking them on fishing trips. He said he is disappointed that the United States does not seem to have learned lessons from Vietnam, where 58,000 American troops were killed in a war that failed to stop Communist North Vietnam taking over the entire Vietnamese peninsula. ""We should avoid war at all costs,"" Lilley said. ""Don't rush into the racket of war, into the machine of making money, contracts. A lot of people made a lot of money off of this.""  He said it took him years to let go of his anger.  ""I mean I knew what I was getting into, I mean I grew up on Rambo. I wanted to honor my family in the sense my grandfather fought in War World Two, I wanted to go down that same route and do the selfless thing, but it turns into reality quickly.""  Another of Lilley's Iraq and Afghanistan veteran buddies is Tristan Wimmer, also a Marine scout sniper. Wimmer's brother Kiernan, also a Marine veteran, died by suicide in 2015 after receiving a traumatic brain injury in Iraq before deploying to Afghanistan. Wimmer, 37, now runs ""22 Jumps,"" holding fundraising events where he does 22 parachute base jumps in a day to raise awareness about the scourge of veteran suicide. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) estimated in 2012 that 22 U.S. veterans die by suicide each day.  A VA spokesperson said via email that the department is dedicated to former veterans' physical and mental health. This starts with a program called VA Solid Start (VASS), which ensures all veterans returning to civilian life are aware of and have access to an array of help and benefits. Contact is made with them three times in their first year out of the military. Help under VASS is tailored to a veteran's individual needs and includes access to mental healthcare and resources to ease the stress during the transition to civilian life. Wimmer said of Afghanistan: ""By any metric you choose to measure it, it was a fruitless effort. Getting rid of al Qaeda or the Taliban - we didn't succeed. Increased peace and prosperity for the Afghan people? We didn't succeed.  ""In the process we sacrificed a lot of wealth, we sacrificed a lot of time, we sacrificed a lot of lives, not just American lives, but coalition lives and especially Afghan lives, to walk away essentially having accomplished not a lot. That's a really hard thing to stomach.""

"A man sits next to a bank's electronic board showing the Hong Kong share index at Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Asian shares fell Tuesday (July 20, 2021) as worries were growing that a faster-spreading variant of the coronavirus could upend the global economic recovery. - AP TOKYO, July 20 (AP): Asian shares fell Tuesday as worries were growing that a faster-spreading variant of the coronavirus could upend the global economic recovery. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.9% to 27,417.75. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.6% to 3,226.19. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined 0.5% to 7,252.20. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.1% to 27,189.43, while the Shanghai Composite fell 0.2% to 3,531.54. Worries about the pandemic continue in Japan, with three days to go before the Tokyo Olympics open. Some 11,000 athletes are taking part in the Games, and 22,000 other people have arrived since July 1 to take part in the Games. Several athletes and more than 60 other non-athletes affiliated with the Games have tested positive. Fears are growing that, despite repeated tests, infections may spread. The vaccination rollout has been slower in Japan than in other developed nations, with just 22% of the population fully vaccinated. Reports that fully vaccinated people have gotten infected are another cause for worry. The Japanese government has repeatedly promised ""a safe and secure"" Games. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 1.6% to 4,258.49, after setting a record just a week earlier. In another sign of worry, the yield on the 10-year Treasury touched its lowest level in five months as investors scrambled for safer places to put their money. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was steady at 1.21% after falling to 1.20% Monday from 1.29% late Friday. In March it was at roughly 1.75%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 2.1% to 33,962.04, while the Nasdaq composite lost 1.1% to 14,274.98. Airlines and other companies that would get hurt the most by potential COVID-19 restrictions took some of the heaviest losses, similar to the early days of the pandemic in February and March 2020. United Airlines lost 5.5%, mall owner Simon Property Group gave up 5.9%, and cruise operator Carnival fell 5.7%. The World Health Organization says cases and deaths are climbing globally after a period of decline, spurred by the highly contagious delta variant. And given how tightly connected the global economy is, a hit anywhere can quickly affect the other side of the world. Even in the U.S., where the vaccination rate is higher than in many other countries, people in Los Angeles County must once again wear masks indoors regardless of whether they're vaccinated following spikes in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Any worsening of virus trends threatens the high prices that stocks have achieved on expectations the economy will fulfill those lofty forecasts. ""It’s a bit of an overreaction, but when you have a market that’s at record highs, that’s had the kind of run we’ve had, with virtually no pullback, it becomes extremely vulnerable to any sort of bad news,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading & derivatives at Charles Schwab. ""It was just a matter of what that tipping point was, and it seems we finally reached that this morning” with worries about the delta variant. He and other analysts are optimistic stocks can rebound quickly. Investors have been trained recently to see every dip in stocks as merely an opportunity to buy low. Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, was more pessimistic. He says the stock market may be in the early stages for a drop of as much as 10% following its big run higher. The S&P 500 nearly doubled after hitting its bottom in March 2020. ""The valuations, they just got too frothy,"" he said. ""There was just so much optimism out there.” Besides the new variants of the coronavirus, other risks to the economy include fading pandemic relief efforts from the U.S. government and a Federal Reserve that looks set to begin paring back its assistance for markets later this year. Monday's selling pressure was widespread, with nearly 90% of the stocks in the S&P 500 lower. Even Big Tech stocks fell, with Apple down 2.7% and Microsoft 1.3% lower. This week also brings a slew of earnings reports. Across the S&P 500, analysts are forecasting profit growth of nearly 70% for the second quarter from a year earlier. That would be the strongest growth since 2009, when the economy was climbing out of the Great Recession. In energy trading, benchmark US crude rose 10 cents to US$66.52 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, added 40 cents to US$69.02 a barrel. In currency trading, the US dollar rose to 109.52 Japanese yen from 109.46 yen. The euro fell to $1.1779 from $1.1802. - AP ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"Both parties will remain in close contact and monitor the public health situation in both places before taking stock in late August. - The Straits Times/ANN SINGAPORE, July 20 (The Straits Times/ANN): The long-anticipated quarantine free travel corridor plan between Hong Kong and Singapore will not be taking off any time soon. Singapore's Transport Minister S. Iswaran and Hong Kong's Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau have jointly agreed to resume discussions on the Singapore-Hong Kong Air Travel Bubble (ATB) only when the Covid-19 situation allows. ""Both parties will remain in close contact and monitor the public health situation in both places before taking stock in late August on the ATB,"" Singapore's Transport Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday (July 20). This comes as Singapore tightened its Covid-19 measures from Thursday (July 22) to Aug 18, as the Republic goes back to phase two (heightened alert) to stem a recent spike in community cases. Singapore saw a record high of 182 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases as at Tuesday afternoon, including 135 cases connected to the growing cluster linked to the Jurong Fishery Port. A spokesman for the Hong Kong government said that, given the recent surge of cases in Singapore, the condition for launching the ATB ""could not be met for the time being"". The spokesman also said both Hong Kong and Singapore have agreed that a review of the way forward could be conducted late next month, taking into account the effectiveness of the enhanced infection control measures implemented by Singapore and the global situation at that time. The Hong Kong-Singapore travel scheme was slated to launch last November but was postponed to May after Hong Kong had a surge in cases. It was derailed again when the number of coronavirus cases began to rise in Singapore, with the situation stabilising early last month, before the recent spike in cases. Last week, Hong Kong legislators had urged the government to scrap the plan as Singapore shifts from a zero-infection strategy, which Hong Kong places great importance on. They reasoned that having zero coronavirus cases is a requirement for the territory to reopen borders with the mainland. Under Singapore’s transition from dealing with Covid-19 as a pandemic to managing it as endemic, its Government aims to fully inoculate two-thirds of its 5.7 million population by early next month. In an interview with Bloomberg TV recently, Singapore's Health Minister Ong Ye Kung expressed optimism that the travel plan with Hong Kong would materialise. ""With very low Covid-19 case counts, or none at all on many days, the cities are well positioned to open their borders again,"" Mr Ong said. ""That gives us common ground to talk again about restarting the air travel bubble."" - The Straits Times/ANN LAW graduates have many career options.

"Muslim pilgrims cast stones at a pillar symbolizing Satan during the annual Haj pilgrimage, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, in Mina, near the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Ahmed Yosri JAMARAT, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) -     Restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 during the Muslim haj in Saudi Arabia have also reduced the risk of the deadly crowd crushes that have marred the pilgrimage's symbolic stoning of the devil in past years, worshippers said on Tuesday. Before the pandemic, the annual haj rite typically drew more than two million Muslim faithful from around the world, with crowding regularly leading to dangerous incidents, most recently a 2015 stampede that killed hundreds. But only a limited number of mask-clad pilgrims hurled pebbles at a wall in a symbolic renunciation of the devil - historically the haj's riskiest ceremony - during Tuesday's Eid al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice).  For the second year running Saudi Arabia has banned worshippers from abroad and has allowed only 60,000 citizens and residents to participate in the haj. ""In the past it was overly crowded and people were jostling and scrambling at Jamarat and some were hurt,"" said Mohammed Salehi, a Syrian living in Saudi Arabia, referring to the site of the stoning ceremony.  Saudi Arabia stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina and the peaceful organisation of the haj, which has in the past been afflicted by fires and riots as well as stampedes. Multi-billion dollar government-funded upgrades to haj infrastructure since 2015, including erecting a three-storey bridge in Jamarat to ease congestion, have greatly reduced the frequency of such disasters. And, in a speech marking Eid al-Adha, King Salman lauded measures taken by the kingdom to ensure a safe haj ""in the shadow of this pandemic"" including deploying technology to allow physical distancing. With the coronavirus the main concern, authorities have restricted access to pilgrims aged 18 to 65, who have either been fully vaccinated or have recovered for the virus and do not suffer from chronic diseases.     This year, face-masked pilgrims clad in white robes signifying a state of purity walked in small groups, each at their own pace and socially distanced. ""They had pre-packed stones for us,"" said Pakistani pilgrim Urooj Qasmi. ""I'm not scared. Everything is very clean and well organised."" Worshippers will return to Jamarat over the next two days before continuing onto Mecca to pray at the Grand Mosque at the end of haj, a once-in-a-lifetime duty for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it.

"SAMUT PRAKAN, Thailand, July 20 (Reuters): Two Thai health workers zip up their protective suits, put on masks and face shields and slowly climb aboard a small boat waiting in the reeds on the banks of a countryside canal. This is the best way to ensure remote communities in Samut Prakan, a province on the fringes of the capital Bangkok, get some access to checkups as the country struggles to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The workers navigate these small canals daily, carrying out checks on communities and nose and throat swab tests on the Covid-19 patients who are isolating themselves, in an already isolated village. ""Some areas of the village can't be accessed by land, so we need to travel by boat or raft to check on Covid-19 patients,"" said public health officer Charoenrat Chaibut. About 10% of the 60 households in the village were infected with Covid-19, the health authority estimates. Thailand reported 11,784 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, the fourth consecutive day of record infections, as it deals with its longest-running and most severe outbreak so far. Local people help by providing the transport - a narrow wooden boat with a small engine and propeller ""I'm doing this for the patients as it is quite hard to travel and I'm glad the locals are accommodating us,"" Charoenrat said. Though they are able to reach the patients for now, Charoenrat is concerned that the virus keeps spreading even in these remote areas.

"FILE PHOTO: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan gives a statement after a cabinet meeting in Ankara, Turkey, May 17, 2021. Murat Cetinmuhurdar/PPO/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo NICOSIA (Reuters) -     Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday peace talks on the future of ethnically divided Cyprus can take place only between ""the two states"" on the Mediterranean island. In a speech in the divided Cypriot capital of Nicosia, Erdogan reiterated Turkey's position in a dispute that is damaging Turkey's relations with the European Union and Greece. Turkey is the only country to now recognise breakaway north Cyprus. It says the only viable option to heal decades of estrangement is for rival Greek Cypriots and the international community to accept the existence of two sovereign entities. Greek Cypriots, who represent the island internationally and are backed by the EU, reject a two-state deal which would imply a sovereign status to a breakaway state they view illegal. ""The new negotiation process can only be carried out between the two states. We are right and we will defend our right to the end,"" Erdogan said.  Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion on July 20, 1974, five days after a Greek Cypriot coup engineered by the military junta then ruling Greece.  Decked out in red-and-white Turkish and Turkish Cypriot flags, the celebratory mood in north Nicosia stood in stark contrast with the sombre mood in the south, where Greek Cypriots were woken by air raid sirens marking the day Turkish forces landed 47 years ago. The United Nations has grappled inconclusively with the Cyprus conflict for decades.  The simmering dispute is now in sharper focus because of competing claims over offshore energy reserves, and a recent re-opening by Turkish Cypriots of part of Varosha, a ghost resort which was the hub of Cyprus's tourism industry before the war.

"A general view of the Lebenshilfe Haus, a care home in an area affected by floods caused by heavy rainfalls, in Sinzig, Germany, July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay BERLIN (Reuters) -German Chancellor Angela Merkel headed again to the country's flood disaster zone on Tuesday, her government besieged by questions over how Europe's richest economy was caught flat-footed by flooding that had been predicted days earlier. The floods have killed more than 160 people in Germany since tearing through villages, sweeping away houses, roads and bridges last week, highlighting gaps in how warnings of severe weather are passed on to the population. With the country about 10 weeks away from national elections, the floods have put the crisis management skills of Germany's leaders on the agenda, with opposition politicians suggesting the death toll revealed serious failings in Germany's flood preparedness. Government officials on Monday rejected suggestions that they had done too little to prepare for the floods and said warning systems had worked. As the search continues for survivors, Germany is starting to count the financial cost of its worst natural disaster in almost 60 years.  On her first visit to a flood-stricken town on Sunday, a shaken Merkel had described the flooding as ""terrifying"", promising swift financial aid. Rebuilding destroyed infrastructure will require a ""major financial effort"" in the coming years, a draft document showed on Tuesday. For immediate relief, the federal government plans to provide 200 million euros ($236 million) in emergency aid to repair buildings, damaged local infrastructure and to help people in crisis situations, the draft document, due to go to cabinet on Wednesday, showed. That will come on top of 200 million euros that would come from the 16 federal states. The government also hopes for financial support from the European Union's solidarity fund. During a visit on Saturday to parts of Belgium also hit by the floods, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the communities Europe was with them. ""We are with you in mourning and we will be with you in rebuilding,"" she said. Southern Germany has also been hit by floods and the state of Bavaria is initially making 50 million euros available in emergency aid for victims, Bavaria's premier said on Tuesday. German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze called for greater financial resources to prevent extreme weather events caused by climate change.  ""The current events in so many places in Germany show with what force the consequences of climate change can hit us all,"" she told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper.  Currently, the government is limited in what it can do to support flood and drought prevention by the constitution, she said, adding she would favour anchoring adaptations for climate change in the Basic Law. Experts say the floods that hit northwestern Europe last week should act as a warning that long-term climate change prevention is needed.

"FILE PHOTO: South African former President Jacob Zuma speaks to supporters after appearing at the High Court in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, May 17, 2021. REUTERS/Rogan Ward JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -A South African court granted former President Jacob Zuma's request for a delay in his arms deal corruption trial on Tuesday, and adjourned proceedings for three weeks. Zuma is accused of receiving kickbacks over a $2 billion arms deal from the 1990s. He pleaded not guilty in May to charges including corruption, fraud and money laundering. He has evaded prosecution for more than a decade, and portrayed himself as the victim of a politically motivated witch-hunt.  Efforts to hold him to account are seen as a test of the country's ability to hold powerful politicians to account. ""The trial is adjourned to 10-13 August 2021,"" Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Piet Koen said. He did not give the reasons why he allowed the delay. Zuma has started a 15-month sentence for contempt of court. He appeared before the Pietermaritzburg court virtually but stayed silent while his legal team argued that a postponement should be granted so that he could appear in person. Zuma's jailing this month triggered some of the worst unrest of the post-apartheid era. There were fears his latest court appearance could lead to a flare-up of violent protests from his support base. That has not materialised so far.

"Mary Schaus remembers how angry she was the day an attendant refused to unlock a toilet for the disabled, and her eight-year-old autistic son wet himself. But that incident not only sparked her desire to raise awareness about people with special needs, but also inspired a new charity, the Talos Foundation, named after her son, Alexander Talos Schaus. It hands out lanyards and stickers with a message in Chinese and English, saying: “Special Needs: Kindness and Compassion.” Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with  , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Schaus, 45, an American who has lived in Hong Kong for 17 years and works in human resources for a law firm, recalled the incident in February that started it all. She and her businessman husband David, also 45, had taken Alexander for a special needs class at a municipal centre in Central﻿ when he needed to use the toilet. She took him to the disabled toilet, only to find it locked. When she asked the attendant to open it, he refused, saying it was only for disabled people and disregarded her son’s disabled card. “I was very angry. It was just wrong,” said Schaus, who also has an older son, Kane, 12, born in Hong Kong as well. Calming down took a while, before she realised one day that she had a choice. “You can make the best of a situation, or you can be really angry and bitter. I decided to make the best of a situation,” she said. She remembered how she found a way to help her father, who has Alzheimer’s and sometimes acts out in public. She made business cards for her mother to hand out, and a button that said: “My name is Jim. I have Alzheimer’s. Thank you for your patience.” Schaus spent a month and put her money into working with a designer to create 100 lanyards and stickers, with the symbol of a head with a heart inside and the message appealing for kindness and compassion towards those with special needs. She tested her creation in May, while on a family staycation at a hotel in Sha Tin. On one occasion, a hotel employee who spotted the sticker took Schaus and Alexander to a separate entrance to help them use the toilet. She then posted the design on Hong Kong Moms, a private Facebook group with 64,900 members, and was shocked when hundreds of people as well as companies responded, offering to help distribute the lanyards and stickers. Schaus decided to set up the charity, and is in the process of getting the paperwork done. Since last month, about 2,000 lanyards and stickers have been sent to about 20 distribution points, such as physiotherapy offices, bookstores and playgroups, for people to pick up free of charge. Over the past few weeks, more companies have contacted her to say they are keen to help run events to educate and raise awareness among the public. Hong Kong has more than 57,000 students with special educational needs (SEN) spanning learning difficulties, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders, speech and language impairment, intellectual disability, hearing impairment, physical disability, visual impairment and mental illness. Schaus said Alexander was diagnosed with autism and intellectual disabilities in 2016, when he was three. She said strangers had stared or yelled at her many times because they misunderstood the boy’s behaviour. Other parents of special needs children say the same thing too. “They get yelled at. They get criticised. The children get bullied for exhibiting behaviours that people do not think are OK or normal,” Schaus said. Wendy Huang Wen-jie, community organiser with the Society for Community Organisation, an NGO that helps the underprivileged, said she believed Schaus’ product was a good idea. Huang said although there was more awareness of special needs children in Hong Kong today, some people were still confused by their behaviour and found it hard to accept. When children such as those with ADHD acted differently in public, for example, people tended to assume the parents had not taught the children to behave, Huang added. Schaus hopes her lanyards and stickers can go a small way towards raising awareness and addressing the prejudice towards families such as hers. “Little things like this can help. This will hopefully help people understand that everyone is different,” she said. LAW graduates have many career options. The most obvious is in the legal profession as an advocate and solicitor.

" hit a record low in the first half of the year as  China’s exports to North Korea fell by 85.2 per cent year on year to US$56.77 million in the first six months of 2021, according to Chinese customs data released on Sunday. It was the lowest figure since China started releasing the data in 2001. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with  , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. China imported US$8.96 million of goods from its neighbour over the same period, down 67.3 per cent from a year earlier and another record low. The sharp decline comes after North Korea doubled down on its border controls last month as fast-spreading coronavirus variants extended their reach around the world. At the same time, Pyongyang has faced growing food shortages and economic instability at home. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un warned last month that the agricultural sector failed to meet grain production targets because of typhoon damage last year, and the country’s food situation was “getting intense”, according to state media. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization forecast that North Korea was facing a   this year, and the country could have a “harsh lean period” as early as August. North Korea is highly dependent on its trade with China for food, as well as fertiliser and fuel. However, it was among the first countries to close its borders with China after the initial coronavirus outbreak was reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in January.  between the two countries a week ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Kim that “China is determined to support North Korea’s economic development and improvements to people’s livelihoods”. In terms of monthly figures, China exported US$12.32 million of goods to North Korea in June, nearly six times the US$2.71 million the previous month but still a year-on-year decline of about 86 per cent. Chinese imports from North Korea also fell by 80 per cent to US$1.82 million last month, although the figure was more than double the US$750,000 reported for May. China’s exports to North Korea have declined 16 months in a row year on year amid the fallout from Covid-19. The only exception was a brief rebound this April, when there were signs that the two neighbours were easing border restrictions amid tensions with the United States. Observers in China said stalled nuclear talks between North Korea and the United States meant UN sanctions remained in place, restricting China’s trade with North Korea. Some of that bilateral trade would recover but not to pre-sanctions levels, analysts said. LAW graduates have many career options.

"KAJANG: The chief executive officer of the Bangi Avenue Convention Centre (BACC) vaccination centre has denied claims that a man was nearly injected with an empty syringe. Kajang OCPD Asst Comm Mohd Zaid Hassan said they received a report from the CEO at around 2.50pm on Sunday (July 18). ""He lodged the report to deny a tweet (in which) a male vaccine recipient... alleged he was almost jabbed with an empty syringe there on Saturday. ""However, during our checks, we could not find any video or pictures of the incident,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday (July 20). He said investigations found that the staff at the centre had clearly communicated and explained the procedure for vaccination to the man but he was not satisfied. ""It was all just a misunderstanding. The man believed he was injected with an empty syringe but he had actually received the Sinovac vaccine. ""As of now, no police report has been lodged by the recipient or any other individual on the issue,"" he said, adding that the BACC official only lodged a report to deny that such an incident occurred. He said the case was being investigated for misuse of network facilities under Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act. ""Investigations revealed that the tweet was made by the recipient's girlfriend... the community (received) it negatively.

"VIENTIANE, July 20 (Vientiane Times/ANN): The surge in imported cases of Covid-19 has prompted the government to extend the virus control measures outlined in Prime Ministerial Order No. 15 for another 15 days until August 3. However, some restrictions have been lifted to minimise the impacts on the economy and people’s livelihoods. A severe Covid outbreak and job losses in Thailand have forced many Lao nationals working there to return home, with at least 15 percent of returnees testing positive for the virus. “Although the number of community-acquired cases in Laos is falling, we must remain alert and prepare to accommodate Lao workers returning from neighbouring countries,” Deputy Head of the Prime Minister’s office, Thipphakone Chanthavongsa, told a press briefing on Monday. “We have to encourage them to enter Laos legally to keep the virus in check. What we fear is that people are entering illegally, which could result in a major community outbreak.” Indoor and outdoor sports facilities in Vientiane and provinces where is no ongoing virus outbreak may reopen, but must be legally registered businesses. Sports centres must not serve alcohol and must comply with all virus prevention measures. Massage parlours and spas in Vientiane and provinces where there is no ongoing virus outbreak may also reopen but managers and staff must have had two doses of a Covid vaccine and services must end at 8pm. Vocational schools, teacher training colleges and other higher education centres in Vientiane may reopen but must strictly comply with all virus prevention measures. Authorities will continue tracing people known to be carrying the virus after testing and expedite the rollout of the vaccination programme. Pubs and bars, karaoke bars, other entertainment venues, cinemas, snooker halls, and internet cafes will remain closed. Contact sports including football and martial arts remain prohibited in any province with a virus outbreak. Factories and handicraft units in red zones (infected villages) will remain closed, except where employees have received two doses of a Covid vaccine and there are on-site dormitories. Entering or exiting red zones is banned, unless permission is given by authorities. Parties of all kinds remain banned. Members of the public are urged to comply with all virus prevention measures such as temperature checks, social distancing of at least one metre, wearing face masks, and using hand sanitiser. Shopping malls, retail shops, supermarkets, minimarts, night markets and fresh markets will remain open. Barber shops and beauty salons that are not located in red zones can remain open but social distancing must be observed. Restaurants, cafes, tourist sites, and food gardens in provinces without a community outbreak can offer dine-in service, but customers must comply with all virus control measures. People may take out boats to fish in rivers through which international borders run, between the hours of 8am and 6pm, but authorities must specify the number of fishing boats that can use the river each day. - Vientiane Times/ANN DESPITE clinical psychology being a very young profession in Malaysia, it does not mean the service is not needed by people.

"KOTA KINABALU: Police have yet to make an arrest over an incident where a taxi driver went amok at the Kota Kinabalu International Airport on Monday (July 19) and rammed a row of vehicles. Acting Kota Kinabalu OCPD Supt George Rakman said the case is being investigated for reckless driving. ""The driver involved is still receiving treatment at the hospital but a brief statement has been taken,"" he said without elaborating further. In the incident, the taxi driver allegedly rammed into several vehicles after a misunderstanding. However, no one was hurt. It is learnt that a few drivers whose vehicles were damaged may not take legal action against the taxi driver and are now discussing how to resolve the matter, including coming up with funds for repairs. KKIA Limousine and Taxi Association president Shamsuddin Mohd Shah said the driver is known to have come under a lot of stress recently.

"At the SenseTime International AI Innovation Hub, visitors can take photos with an augmented reality simulation of the Merlion and Marina Bay Sands. -  SENSETIME INTERNATIONAL SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): A facility offering immersive experiences with artificial intelligence was launched on Monday (July 19) to encourage firms to experiment with and develop AI innovations for their businesses. Hong Kong-based AI company SenseTime also announced partnerships with Business China and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) to nurture talent in the field through internships and contributions to teaching curriculum. The SenseTime International AI Innovation Hub, a ""living lab"" open to businesses and its partners, features eight zones that showcase real-world AI applications in industries such as education, healthcare and entertainment. Visitors can take photos with an augmented reality simulation of the Merlion and Marina Bay Sands, try on digital make-up, and use hand gestures to control a fan - applications that have relevance to industries such as tourism and retail. Noting that Singapore had tremendous growth potential to become the centre for AI innovation in the region, Dr Xu Li, co-founder and chief executive officer of SenseTime, said: ""We hope to bring more original innovation and responsible AI technologies to accelerate South-east Asia's digital economy."" Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling, the guest of honour at the event, said: ""Recent developments propelled by Covid-19 have highlighted the pressing need for the digital transformation of economies, as well as the importance of pursuing sustainable innovation."" Aspiring students of AI will also get a leg up through the partnerships created on Monday. SenseTime and Business China, a non-profit spearheaded by the Government and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, will jointly provide internship and international exchange opportunities for young people. SenseTime will join the Youth Interns Exchange Scheme (YES) to offer internships to tertiary students at its offices in China and Singapore. Launched last year, YES is a bilateral internship exchange scheme that aims to enhance interaction, understanding and cooperation between Singapore and China. Tin Pei Ling, chief executive officer at Business China, said: ""It's important that our young people are exposed to different cultures and operating environments, and go beyond the textbook to immerse themselves."" With ITE, SenseTime will provide its education curriculum - with more than 250 hours of online project-based training courses -and train ITE educators to teach students to develop AI algorithms. At a panel discussion about the role of AI education in future-proofing Singaporeans that was part of the event, ITE chief executive Low Khah Gek said: ""Young people are open to new technology, and they take it up naturally. Our challenge is that we need educators to be familiar with AI skills and solutions."" Additionally, SenseTime will attach ITE students with its partners to work on AI projects, and work with ITE to develop training programmes in computer vision and smart cities for adult learners. Kiren Kumar, deputy chief executive at the Infocomm Media Development Authority, who was part of the panel, said: ""The need and demand for AI skills has accelerated dramatically. What we have achieved in the last two years is probably more than that in the last five years combined."" He added that while this trend can be attributed in part to the Covid-19 pandemic, it is here to stay. The panel discussion was moderated by Ryan Huang, producer and presenter at MONEY FM 89.3. Speaking to reporters, managing director at SenseTime International Martin Huang urged people to embrace AI. ""AI relieves people from repeating boring work in exhausting environments... that reduces their innovation and energy. From this perspective, I don't see anything bad about AI."" - The Straits Times/Asia News Network DESPITE clinical psychology being a very young profession in Malaysia, it does not mean the service is not needed by people.

"PETALING JAYA: Anyone who received a Covid-19 vaccine shot that is proven to be ""empty"" will be given a proper dose, says Health Minister Datuk Seri Adham Baba. Berita Harian quoted him as saying that the ministry would contact the individuals concerned to receive their vaccines. ""They will be called in for an injection again,"" he said in a brief message to the daily. He was responding to several individuals who recorded themselves during the process and claimed they were not given any Covid-19 vaccine. Several videos have since gone viral on messaging applications and social media. The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) said it was working with the authorities to investigate alleged wrongdoings during vaccinations under the immunisation programme. It added that it would not hesitate to end the services of personnel found to be involved in misconduct. The CITF is investigating two reports of empty syringes being used during the vaccination process. One case allegedly took place at the Malaysia International Trade and Exhibition Centre on July 17, which was reported by a member of the public. The other case allegedly took place at the Bangi Avenue Convention Centre on Sunday (July 18), and a report was made by a healthcare officer there.

"BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, July 19 (Xinhua): Brunei on Monday (July 19) suspended all entry from Indonesia due to their Covid-19 situation and rising imported cases from the country. According to Brunei's Prime Minister's Office (PMO), following the ongoing situation of Covid-19 in Indonesia, approvals on the entry for foreign nationals departing from or through Indonesia are temporarily suspended with immediate effect until further notice, which applies to entry travels of all foreign nationals departing from or through any airport in Indonesia (direct flight) or traveling from Indonesia to Brunei via transit at any other airport. The PMO also said that in addition, the temporary suspension also applies to foreign nationals who have been granted pre-approvals to enter Brunei from Indonesia.

"Seventy per cent of Hongkongers will have received their first shots of a   by the end of September if the city can continue administering them at its current rate of 30,000 a day for the next two months, according to a top official. Patrick Nip Tak-kuen, the civil service chief who is also in charge of Hong Kong’s vaccination campaign, on Sunday said at least 2 million people still needed to get vaccinated and that progress towards achieving herd immunity was dependent on encouraging the elderly to take the jab. “If we don’t make use of the time we have to get vaccinated and reach a vaccination rate of 70 per cent, we will not be able to reach herd immunity,” he told a radio show, with the city’s inoculation drive still struggling to gain traction. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with  , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Nip stressed that herd immunity was a precondition for the city returning to normal and reopening its borders, saying it provided added protection against mutant strains of the coronavirus. “If we maintain the pace of having about 30,000 people getting their first shot every day, we would get about 1 million vaccinated in a month, which would mean 70 per cent of people would have received their first jab in the following two months,” he said. Herd immunity against the coronavirus is possible when at least 70 per cent of the population have received two doses of a  , according to an assessment by government advisers on public health. Nip’s vaccination plea came as Hong Kong confirmed two new imported Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking the city’s official tally to 11,958 cases, with 211 related deaths. As of Sunday evening, 37.6 per cent of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million people had received one dose of the vaccine, and 26.8 per cent have been given both doses. Nip urged members of the public to book a vaccine appointment as soon as possible. “The community vaccination centres cannot stay open indefinitely,” Nip added, with the 29 centres offering the BioNTech and Sinovac vaccines projected to close at the end of August. He added that authorities would monitor booking patterns and operations across the inoculation centres over the next two weeks to determine if specific locations needed more vaccination booths. About 1,000 private doctor clinics administering the Sinovac jabs would continue to operate past the August deadline with a cumulative vaccination capacity of 6,000 shots per day, Nip added. Less than 25 per cent of those aged 60 and above have received their jabs, which Nip emphasised was a cause of concern as vulnerable groups were more susceptible to the coronavirus. Only 5 per cent of those living in care homes for the elderly and disabled have received at least one jab as of early July. While vaccination centres had been fairly busy recently, Nip added the government was exploring arranging walk-in slots for the elderly, so they could turn up for jabs without booking online. Outreach programmes in which private doctors and medical staff hold seminars explaining the safety and importance of the vaccines would also continue across elderly care homes planning to administer the Sinovac vaccines to its residents. Since Friday, the government has offered an added incentive of HK$50 to private doctors, who successfully administer the mainland China-produced Sinovac jabs to each elderly patient. Nip said the new initiative was aimed at compensating doctors for the extra time it took to explain the potential risks of the vaccines and allay safety concerns for the older population, who often also have underlying illnesses. Civil servants, especially those with frontline duties, were also urged to get vaccinated, as about 30 per cent of government workers still had not. “People have two options – either get vaccinated or get tested every two weeks [at your own expense],” Nip stressed, referring to civil servants. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Thursday told lawmakers that the government was working towards extending compulsory vaccination or testing to cover more of the 170,000-strong civil service, buoyed by the policy achieving high levels of inoculation among 64,000 of Hong Kong’s frontline officers. Under the scheme, frontline workers were required to get coronavirus jabs or undergo regular testing. Hong Kong has largely kept Covid-19 infections and deaths to a minimum, but has struggled to reopen its borders amid a sluggish vaccination rate.

"PETALING JAYA: The vaccines produced by Sinovac and Pfizer-BioNTech are equally effective in preventing severe Covid-19 infections, says Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah. The Health director-general said medical data in real-world settings showed that both had similar efficacy rates against the virus. He cited a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 7 which detailed the use of the Sinovac vaccine in Chile from February to May. “Sinovac was found to reduce Covid-19 infection by 65.9%, reduce hospitalisation by 87.5%, reduce ICU admissions by 90.3% and reduce deaths by 86.3%,” he said in a Facebook post on Tuesday (July 20). He added that the study had looked at 4.2 million fully-vaccinated people against 5.5 million unvaccinated residents, as well as having documented 218,784 Covid-19 cases. “In contrast, the Pfizer trial which reported an efficacy of 95% was very small and analysed only 170 Covid-19 cases – eight in the vaccinated group and 162 in the unvaccinated group,” he said. He added that Israel's Ministry of Health pointed out that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the infection fell to 64% since June 6, although it was still 93% effective against hospitalisation and serious illness. “Therefore, there is not much difference between the Sinovac and Pfizer vaccines in actual practical use. Both are very effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalisation, but less effective against mild or asymptomatic Covid-19,” he said.

"Photo taken on Sept 9, 2020 shows the view of the skyscrapers of the Central Business District in Beijing, capital of China. - Xinhua BEIJING (China Daily/ANN): China's business environment has become more accessible for European companies in a number of areas, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said. Many firms, the chamber's leaders said, are reinforcing their position in joint ventures and onshore supply chains. Besides, European companies are increasing spending in China to enlarge their local market share, they said. Charlotte Roule, the chamber's board member, said China is rolling out the red carpet for companies with technologies that the country needs for its overall industrial upgrade and to meet its decarbonisation targets. In this context, she mentioned machinery, chemicals, semiconductors, green energy and environmental services. The chamber found companies in segments like consumer goods, automotive, services like consulting, education and healthcare, and financial services like insurance and banking, that onshored in China are seen with fast growth. China-EU trade surged 26.7 per cent year-on-years to 2.52 trillion yuan (US$390.35 billion) in the first half of this year, while foreign direct investment from European companies in China soared 50.7 per cent year-on-year, data from the General Administration of Customs and the Ministry of Commerce showed. Roule said European companies are taking steps to secure their operations in China and mitigate exposure to geopolitical trends to have a better chance of navigating a potentially fraught near- to medium-term future. ""This is unsurprising as companies cannot be globally competitive without a strong presence in China,"" she said, adding if the United States and China proceed down the path of trade conflicts and technological divergence, then it is imperative that exposure be minimized. For many European companies in China, that means onshoring as much as possible. ""The European business community in China hopes that each side will now consider how they might proceed with the commitments made under the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), regardless of whether or not the deal will be ratified,"" said Roule. Her view was shared by Liu Chang, chair of the chamber's government affairs forum. Liu said that in the context of market demand, supply chain stability, global companies' existing footprint, current growth in China or future development strategy, China-US or China-EU decoupling is not realistic. Any such course will likely harm either side. ""To meet the common challenges brought by Covid-19 and other factors, we all expect that China and the EU could strengthen their cooperation,"" Liu said, noting that a large number of the chamber's member companies turned a profit in 2020, demonstrating that, even in challenging times, European companies certainly can adapt and be successful. In the past decades, multinational corporations have fully integrated into the development pattern of the Chinese economy and its constituent industries, and became an integral part of globalization, said Liu, who is also the vice-president for China unit at Knorr-Brese AG, a German braking and control systems provider for commercial vehicles and trains. Sun Fuquan, vice-president of the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development, said European companies continue to see business opportunities in China not only in areas like rapidly growing trend of high-quality domestic consumption, but also in new areas like new digital technologies that the country has shown time and again it readily adopts. - China Daily/Asia News Network DESPITE clinical psychology being a very young profession in Malaysia, it does not mean the service is not needed by people.

"A member of the media has his temperature taken during an escorted and controlled tour for media representatives, ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, in Tokyo, Japan, July 19, 2021.  REUTERS/Molly Darlington TOKYO (Reuters) -     Foreign reporters covering the Tokyo Olympics were surprised to learn that what they thought was a chance to report outside their media ""bubble"" turned out instead to be a socially distanced sightseeing tour. Hoping to step out and report on the Tokyo beyond the Games, they were on Monday instead ferried by harried organisers from one empty tourist spot to another for two hours. Foreign reporters, largely confined by COVID-19 rules to their hotels and Olympic sites, have already chafed at measures such as GPS tracking and bans on interviewing ordinary people. Some Japanese media have in turn staked out visitors to see if they break quarantine. With the Olympics opening on Friday, organisers say the curbs are fair ways to fight Japan's spreading epidemic. Overseas media outlets have protested that they restrict press freedom, Kyodo agency reported. With repeated temperature checks, site visits limited to 30 minutes and social distancing, the reporters on Monday's trip took in sites including the Tokyo National Museum and the Hama-Rikyu Gardens, a bayside villa for feudal lords. ""We just went to the national museum with no photo-shoot permits, so that's no use for the media,"" said Finnish reporter Heikki Valkama.  Mikai Asai of the Japanese Tourism Board said the idea was to give cooped-up reporters some downtime to explore the capital safely.     ""Due to the many restrictions, (journalists) are not allowed to go outside to take photographs. But we’d like to share the Japanese culture, and for everyone to enjoy it as part of our hospitality,"" she said.

"Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính in a phone conversation with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on July 19,]. — VNA/VNS  HANOI (Vietnam News/ANN): Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính talked over the phone with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte late Monday (July 19), affirming that the archipelago nation is always an important and trustworthy partner that shares many concerns and strategic interests with Vietnam. The Government leader of Vietnam said relations between the two countries have been consistently growing throughout the last 45 years, since diplomatic ties were established on July 12, 1976. President Duterte noted the Philippine Government and people have consistently treasured and worked to develop the countries’ strategic partnership, and they appreciate Vietnam’s meaningful assistance in the recent past, including providing medical supplies for the fight against Covid-19. The two leaders agreed to work closely together to promote relations in all aspects, with a focus on implementing the plan of action for 2019-24, carrying out activities marking the 45th founding anniversary of the diplomatic relationship, enhancing cooperation in security-defence and trade-investment, and creating favourable conditions for and encouraging enterprises to invest and do business in the sectors matching the countries’ potential and strength. Chính highlighted Vietnam’s readiness to continue ensuring stable and long-term rice supply for the Philippines, asking to further open its market to food and agricultural products from Vietnam. The leaders agreed to consider expanding cooperation to new areas amid the Fourth Industrial Revolution such as digital transformation, the digital economy, e-commerce, and the green economy. They also shared the view that vaccine is an important strategy in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and work towards sustainable socio-economic recovery. The Vietnamese PM said the two sides should cooperate more actively to secure equal access to vaccine sources, an idea highly valued by the Philippine President. Regarding regional and international issues, both agreed their countries will strengthen ties and support each other at multilateral mechanisms like the United Nations and Asean. They also agreed to work closely to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement. The leaders shared the view on the importance of continuing to maintain Asean’s solidarity and principles relevant to the East Sea issue. They affirmed the close coordination of their stances and viewpoints to ensure the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC) and accelerate the negotiation on a Code of Conduct (COC) on the waters between Asean and China in order to achieve an effective and substantive COC that accords with international law and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, thereby helping to sustain regional peace and stability. On this occasion, President Duterte invited Chính to pay an official visit to the Philippines. The Vietnamese leader accepted the invitation. — Vietnam News/Asia News Network ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"GEORGE TOWN: Eighteen people, including a teenage school dropout, have been arrested over an online loan scam that caused RM3mil in losses. Penang Commercial Crime Investigation Department chief Asst Comm Mohd Rosni Mohd Lazim said the group members, aged between 16 and 23, were arrested in two raids in Batu Ferringhi on July 15. “During the raid on a house in Jalan Sungai Emas Satu at 1am, we arrested 12 people, including two women. Preliminary investigations show that one of the suspects is a tenant of the house while the underaged boy is a dropout. “We seized 34 mobile phones, two laptops and 14 ATM cards,” he told reporters at the Penang police contingent headquarters here yesterday.ACP Mohd Rosni said following the first raid, one of the suspects led police to another house in Solok Sungai Emas, Batu Ferringhi, on the same day, which led to the further arrest of five men and a woman. “During the second raid, we seized 10 mobile phones, a laptop and 11 ATM cards,” he said. The syndicate’s modus operandi is to offer loans on social media. “Victims will be asked to give their personal information and the loan amount required. “The syndicate members will then contact the victims and ask them to make various payments as processing fees before the loan is approved. After the victims have made the payment, their calls will be blocked,” he said. At the same press conference, Penang Narcotics Crime Investigation Department chief Asst Comm Mustafa Kamal Gani Abdullah said a drug-trafficking syndicate doubling as a coconut delivery service had been detected with the arrest of four men and the seizure of 23.85kg of heroin worth RM265,000. “Police stopped a lorry at a roadblock along the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway at 10.05am on Sunday. A search inside the vehicle led to the discovery of 53 packets of heroin. The driver and two co-drivers, aged between 26 and 32, were detained,” he said. Following the trio’s arrest, police picked up a fourth man, a 35-year-old lorry driver, in Rungkup, Bagan Datuk, at 4pm the same day. ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"BANGKOK (The Nation/ANN): Foodpanda delivery staff member, who allegedly took part in an anti-government protest on Sunday (July 18), was arrested in Pathum Thani province on Monday on several charges. Police on Monday arrested Sitthichote Setsawet following a Criminal Court warrant on charges that included defaming, insulting and threatening the King and Queen, arson, and violation of the Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency Situations, which prohibit public gathering in maximum control areas during the pandemic. Sitthichote had allegedly participated in a rally at Democracy Monument in Bangkok’s Phra Nakhon district on Sunday to demand the prime minister’s resignation, as well as more effective mRNA vaccines in the government’s inoculation programme. He was allegedly seen in one of the videoclips that were shared online while wearing a Foodpanda uniform. In response, the brand announced via Twitter that he would be fired. Foodpanda said its policies oppose “all kinds of violence and terrorism”. The response was later shared online, triggering calls by pro-democracy protesters and even some restaurant owners for a boycott of the food-delivery app. Amid the online backlash, foodpanda later issued an apology and said it was still examining the incident. - The Nation/Asia News Network ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"PETALING JAYA: The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) is working with the authorities to investigate alleged wrongdoing during the immunisation programme. It said it would not hesitate to end the services of vaccination personnel for misconduct. “CITF views seriously the allegations concerning the Covid-19 jab administration at the vaccination centres that have gone viral. “As such, CITF is now working with the authorities, such as the Royal Malaysia Police and the Malaysian Armed Forces, which are conducting investigations into the matter so such incidents will not occur again,” it said in a statement yesterday. CITF said there were allegations surrounding a drive-through vaccination centre that was specially reserved for Malaysian Armed Forces personnel and their family members. It was alleged that the incident took place on July 17 at a drive-through vaccination centre in Kem Lapangan Terbang Sungai Petani, Kedah. Recently, there were viral claims that an empty syringe was used at the Casualty Receiving Station based at the camp there. “An investigation is being conducted by the Malaysian Armed Forces. “The individuals involved have been asked to come forward to give an explanation. “Disciplinary action has been taken on the vaccination personnel,” CITF said. The task force is also investigating two reports of empty syringe being used during vaccination. One case allegedly took place at the Malaysia International Trade and Exhibition Centre (Mitec) on July 17, which was reported by a member of the public. The other case allegedly took place at the Bangi Avenue Convention Centre on July 18, and a report was made by the healthcare officer there. “Any development about the issue will be announced by the authorities. “CITF will not hesitate to end the service of the personnel involved and will take stern action based on the provisions of the law. “As per the standard operating procedure, every vaccination volunteer must show a full syringe to vaccine recipients before inoculation. “The public is also urged to look at the syringe before and after the vaccination process to have confidence that the vaccination has taken place as it should,” it said. Meanwhile, Kuala Lumpur CID chief Senior Asst Comm Saiful Annuar Yusoff confirmed receiving a report from a man who claimed he was injected with an empty syringe at a vaccination centre. Software engineer Tan Wing Sam wrote on Facebook that he had gone to Mitec on Saturday. “When I walked into the booth, there were two staff members sitting down, and I went in with another patient,” he said. Tan, 28, said he saw a tray with one syringe and a vial but noticed that the plunger on the syringe was pushed right up to the end. “She rubbed my arm with an alcohol swab and just took the empty syringe and jabbed it to my arm. “About two seconds later, she pulled it out, put on a plaster and said it’s all done,” he said. He said when he asked her about the issue, she replied that it should have been done properly but if he wanted she would inject him again,” Tan said. “She then started the process all over again,” he added. Tan then raised the issue with a supervisor, who took him back to the booth and asked the person about the matter and she admitted what she did and apologised. “After I proceeded to the final station, the supervisor called me and assured that I received my vaccination during the second injection,” he said. Earlier this month, another man also claimed of being injected with an empty syringe at a vaccination centre. Selangor police had said an enquiry paper was opened in connection with that case. ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"Over 100,000 seafarers are stranded at sea beyond their regular stints of typically 3-9 months, many without even a day's break on land. - Reuters LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters): ""I've seen grown men cry,"" says Captain Tejinder Singh, who hasn't set foot on dry land in more than seven months and isn't sure when he'll go home. ""We are forgotten and taken for granted,"" he says of the plight facing tens of thousands of seafarers like him, stranded at sea as the Delta variant of the coronavirus wreaks havoc on shore. Singh and most of his 20-strong crew have criss-crossed the globe on an exhausting odyssey: from India to the United States then on to China, where they were stuck off the congested coast for weeks waiting to unload cargo. He was speaking to Reuters from the Pacific Ocean as his ship now heads to Australia. They are among about 100,000 seafarers stranded at sea beyond their regular stints of typically 3-9 months, according to the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), many without even a day's break on land. Another 100,000 are stuck on shore, unable to board the ships they need to earn a living on. The Delta variant devastating parts of Asia - home to many of the world's 1.7 million commercial seafarers - has prompted many nations to cut off land access to visiting crews, in some cases even for medical treatment. Just 2.5% of seafarers - one in every 40 - have been vaccinated, the ICS estimates. The United Nations describes the situation as a humanitarian crisis at sea and says governments should class seafarers as essential workers. Given ships transport around 90% of the world's trade, the deepening crisis also poses a major threat to the supply chains we rely on for everything from oil and iron to food and electronics. Bulk carrier master Singh, from northern India, is not optimistic of going ashore anytime soon; his last stint at sea lasted 11 months. He said his crew of Indians and Filipinos were living out of cabins measuring about 15ft by 6ft. ""Being at sea for a very long time is tough,"" he says, adding that he had heard reports of seafarers killing themselves on other ships. ""The most difficult question to answer is when kids ask, 'Papa when you are coming home?',"" he said from his vessel, which was recently carrying coal. India and the Philippines, both reeling from vicious waves of Covid-19, account for more than a third of the world's commercial seafarers, said Guy Platten, secretary general of the ICS, which represents over 80% of the world's merchant fleet. ""We are seriously disturbed that a second global crew change crisis is looming large on the horizon,"" he told Reuters, referring to a months-long stretch in 2020 when 200,000 seafarers on ships were unable to be relieved. In a snapshot of the situation, this month almost 9% of merchant sailors have been stuck aboard their ships beyond their contracts' expiry, up from just over 7% in May, according to data compiled by the Global Maritime Forum non-profit group from 10 ship managers together responsible for over 90,000 seafarers. The maximum allowed contract length is 11 months, as stipulated by a UN seafaring convention. In normal times, around 50,000 seafarers rotate on and 50,000 rotate off ships per month on average but the numbers are now a fraction of that, according to industry players, though there are no precise figures. The new crew crisis stems from restrictions imposed by major maritime nations across Asia including South Korea, Taiwan and China, which are home to many of the world's busiest container ports. Requirements range from mandatory testing for crews who come from or have visited certain countries, to outright bans on crew changes and berthing operations. ""Asia really is struggling and the only countries you can go about routine crew changes to some extent are Japan and Singapore,"" said Rajesh Unni, chief executive of Synergy Marine Group, a leading ship manager responsible for 14,000 seafarers. ""The issue is that we have one set of people who desperately want to go home because they have finished their tenure, and another set of people onshore that are desperate to get back onboard to earn a living."" The crisis has led to almost half of commercial seafarers either considering leaving the industry or being unsure whether they would stay or go, according to a survey by the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) in March. This suggests a looming labour crunch that would strain the world's 50,000-strong merchant shipping fleet and threaten the integrity of global supply chains. A shortage of container ships carrying consumer products and logjams at ports around the world are already rippling through the retail industry, which has seen freight rates spike to record levels, driving up prices for goods. ""You don't have enough crew anyway. The shipping industry was working on a very lean model,"" said Mark O'Neil, CEO of leading ship manager Columbia Shipmanagement and also president of the international association for ship and crew managers. ""But now we have all of these problems and we have a large number of seafarers taken out of that available crewing pool,"" he said, adding that the result could be vessels unable to sail. Stephen Cotton, general secretary of the ITF, said seafarers were being pushed to their physical and mental limits. ""Some in the industry estimate that as many as 25% fewer seafarers are joining vessels than pre-pandemic,"" he added. ""We have warned that global brands need to be ready for the moment some of these tired and fatigued people finally snap."" While Covid-19 infections in India have retreated from their peak, countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia are grappling surging cases and imposing new lockdowns. ""If it gets worse, which it could well do, or if Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, Ukraine - other crewing centres - experience the same problem, then the wheels would really come off,"" O'Neil added. The gravity of the assessment was echoed by Esben Poulsson, chairman of the board of the ICS. ""In my 50 years in the maritime industry, the crew change crisis has been unprecedented in the devastating impact it has had on seafarers around the world,"" he told his board in June. Most seafarers come from developing nations that have struggled to secure adequate vaccination supplies, leaving many in the maritime industry low on the priority list. Governments with significant access to vaccines have a ""moral responsibility"" towards seafarers, said the ICS's Platten. ""They must follow the lead of the US and the Netherlands and vaccinate non-native crews delivering goods to their ports. They must prioritise seafarer vaccination,"" he added. A total of 55 member countries of the UN shipping agency, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), have classed seafarers as essential workers, said David Hammond, chief executive of the charitable organization Human Rights at Sea. This would allow them to travel more freely and return to their homes, and give them better access to vaccines. ""But what about the other 119 member states and associate members?"" asked Hammond ""Collectively, the global shipping industry is part of a $14 trillion maritime supply chain that cannot seemingly look after its 1.7 million seafarers."" ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"Garuda Indonesia flight attendants welcome guests on Nov. 27, 2019 during the unveiling of the flag carrier's new Airbus A330-900neo at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Banten. -JP JAKARTA (The Jakarta Post/ANN): Flag carrier Garuda Indonesia is facing an insolvency lawsuit over its failure to pay aircraft lease while trying to stay afloat in an industry severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Publicly listed AerCap Ireland Ltd., an aircraft leasing firm based in Dublin, filed on June 4 an insolvency lawsuit against Garuda with the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Australia. During the ongoing trial, Garuda was “in the process of negotiating with AerCap to reach a commercial deal and restructure the contract outside the Court”, the 72-year-old airline company stated in its financial report released on Friday (July 16). In 2020, the report also said Garuda saw its net loss swell to US$2.44 billion from $38.93 million a year earlier, while revenue fell 67.36 per cent year-on-year to $1.49 billion. The insolvency lawsuit came around two weeks before the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) suspended trading of Garuda shares after the airline failed to make timely coupon payments worth $14.8 million on its global sukuk. The airline operated less than one-third of its fleet in May, with the rest grounded due to the outstanding lease issue. Garuda’s dire financial state is reflected in its debt of more than $4.5 billion and monthly losses reaching $100 million, according to estimates of the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Ministry. Earlier in the year, on Feb 16, Helice Leasing SAS and Atterissage SAS filed a lawsuit against Garuda with the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) in a bid to seize collateral for the carrier’s funds stored in its account in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Most recently at home, cargo airline PT My Indo Airlines filed a postponement of debt petition (PKPU) against Garuda on July 9. The trial is set to begin on July 27. “There are no impacts on [our] operational activities as of now,” Garuda said on Friday. The number of domestic air passengers in May was 2.44 million, less than half the 2019 figure, according to Statistics Indonesia (BPS), while it recorded around 40,000 international air passengers, far below the normal level of 1.44 million passengers in 2019. - The Jakarta Post/Asia News Network ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"KUALA LUMPUR: More details on the relaxation of restrictions for those who have been fully vaccinated will be announced after Hari Raya Haji, says Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob. Aside from individuals, the government was also looking at relaxing restrictions on businesses as well, he said. Ismail Sabri said it was being discussed in detail now. “More on this issue will be announced after Hari Raya,” he told reporters after launching the Defence Ministry (Mindef) Prihatin programme at Wisma Pertahanan yesterday. When asked, Ismail Sabri said cases of individuals who could not receive their second vaccine dose due to allergies, severe side effects or health issues would be referred to the Health Ministry. The government was looking at easing restrictions, including allowing those fully vaccinated to travel or dine at restaurants. Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin had said relaxing restrictions was part of the National Recovery Plan. In March, Asean economic ministers discussed the possibility of launching a regional digital vaccine passport, reviving talk of an intra-Asean travel bubble. The Malaysian government said talks were ongoing with countries like Singapore to see whether countries would recognise the MySejahtera app as vaccine passports. In the European Union, those who have completed their doses can now get a vaccine passport-like certificate to enable them to travel. Anyone holding a certificate should, in principle, be exempted from testing or quarantine when crossing a border within the EU (or Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein). Meanwhile, on calls by several parties for compounds for SOP violations at factories to be increased, Ismail Sabri said this could only be done with amendments to the Emergency Ordinance. “Initially, under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act, the compound rate was set at RM1,000. Then Emergency was declared and we made amendments where we increased that rate to RM50,000 for violators. “This was because at the initial rate, our observation was that companies and business premises were not bothered to follow the SOP,” he said. He noted that once the Emergency ends on Aug 1, the compound rate would revert back to RM1,000. Ismail Sabri, who is also the Defence Minister, said Mindef Prihatin aid from Perbadanan Perwira Niaga Malaysia (Pernama) and Bank Islam would be distributed in the form of basic food items at mosques for armed forces personnel, veterans as well as members of the public who are affected financially. ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"China is mass producing its DF-26 - a multipurpose weapon with a range of up to 4,000 kilometres - while the United States is developing new weapons aimed at countering Beijing in the Pacific. - Reuters SEOUL (Reuters): Asia is sliding into a dangerous arms race as smaller nations that once stayed on the sidelines build arsenals of advanced long-range missiles, following in the footsteps of powerhouses China and the United States, analysts say. China is mass producing its DF-26 - a multipurpose weapon with a range of up to 4,000 kilometres - while the United States is developing new weapons aimed at countering Beijing in the Pacific. Other countries in the region are buying or developing their own new missiles, driven by security concerns over China and a desire to reduce their reliance on the United States. Before the decade is out, Asia will be bristling with conventional missiles that fly farther and faster, hit harder, and are more sophisticated than ever before - a stark and dangerous change from recent years, analysts, diplomats, and military officials say. ""The missile landscape is changing in Asia, and it’s changing fast,"" said David Santoro, president of the Pacific Forum. Such weapons are increasingly affordable and accurate, and as some countries acquire them, their neighbours don't want to be left behind, analysts said. Missiles provide strategic benefits such as deterring enemies and boosting leverage with allies, and can be a lucrative export. The long-term implications are uncertain, and there is a slim chance that the new weapons could balance tensions and help maintain peace, Santoro said. ""More likely is that missile proliferation will fuel suspicions, trigger arms races, increase tensions, and ultimately cause crises and even wars,"" he said. According to unreleased 2021 military briefing documents reviewed by Reuters, US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) plans to deploy its new long-range weapons in ""highly survivable, precision-strike networks along the First Island Chain,” which includes Japan, Taiwan, and other Pacific islands ringing the east coasts of China and Russia. The new weapons include the Long-range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), a missile that can deliver a highly manoeuvrable warhead at more than five times the speed of sound to targets more than 2,775 kilometres (1,724 miles) away. An INDOPACOM spokesman told Reuters that no decisions had been made as to where to deploy these weapons. So far, most American allies in the region have been hesitant to commit to hosting them. If based in Guam, a US territory, the LRHW would be unable to hit mainland China. Japan, home to more than 54,000 US troops, could host some of the new missile batteries on its Okinawan islands, but the United States would probably have to withdraw other forces, a source familiar with Japanese government thinking said, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the issue. Allowing in American missiles - which the US military will control - will also most likely bring an angry response from China, analysts said. Some of America's allies are developing their own arsenals. Australia recently announced it would spend US$100 billion over 20 years developing advanced missiles. ""Covid and China have shown that depending on such extended global supply chains in times of crisis for key items - and in war, that includes advanced missiles - is a mistake, so it is sensible strategic thinking to have production capacity in Australia,"" said Michael Shoebridge of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Japan has spent millions on long range air-launched weapons, and is developing a new version of a truck-mounted anti-ship missile, the Type 12, with an expected range of 1,000 kilometres. Among US allies, South Korea fields the most robust domestic ballistic missile programme, which got a boost from a recent agreement with Washington to drop bilateral limits on its capabilities. Its Hyunmoo-4 has an 800-kilometre range, giving it a reach well inside China. ""When the US allies' conventional long-range-strike capabilities grow, the chances of their employment in the event of a regional conflict also increase,"" Zhao Tong, a strategic security expert in Beijing, wrote in a recent report. Despite the concerns, Washington ""will continue to encourage its allies and partners to invest in defence capabilities that are compatible with coordinated operations,"" US Representative Mike Rogers, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, told Reuters. Taiwan has not publicly announced a ballistic missile programme, but in December the U.S. State Department approved its request to buy dozens of American short-range ballistic missiles. Officials say Taipei is mass producing weapons and developing cruise missiles such as the Yun Feng, which could strike as far as Beijing. All this is aimed at ""making the spines of (Taiwan's) porcupine longer as the abilities of China's military improve"", Wang Ting-yu, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, told Reuters, while insisting that the island's missiles were not meant to strike deep in China. One diplomatic source in Taipei said Taiwan's armed forces, traditionally focused on defending the island and warding off a Chinese invasion, are beginning to look more offensive. ""The line between defensive and offensive nature of the weapons is getting thinner and thinner,"" the diplomat added. South Korea has been in a heated missile race with North Korea. The North recently tested what appeared to be an improved version of its proven KN-23 missile with a 2.5-tonne warhead that analysts say is aimed at besting the 2-tonne warhead on the Hyunmoo-4. ""While North Korea still appears to be the primary driver behind South Korea's missile expansion, Seoul is pursuing systems with ranges beyond what is necessary to counter North Korea,"" said Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association in Washington. As proliferation accelerates, analysts say the most worrisome missiles are those that can carry either conventional or nuclear warheads. China, North Korea and the United States all field such weapons. ""It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine if a ballistic missile is armed with a conventional or nuclear warhead until it reaches the target,"" Davenport said. As the number of such weapons increases, ""there is an increased risk of inadvertent escalation to a nuclear strike."" ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"Students standing outside the school hall at River Valley High School, on July 19, 2021. - ST FILE SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): A 16-year-old student from River Valley High School (RVHS) was charged with the murder of a fellow student, 13, in a district court on Tuesday (July 20) morning. The accused cannot be named as he is under 18 years of age. He appeared in court via video link to face one count of murdering the 13-year-old at a level four toilet in the school between 11.16am and 11.44am on Monday. The 16-year-old was in a red polo T-shirt and wearing a mask. His hair was dishevelled and his eyes darted around the room as the charge was read out. The accused, whose parents were not in court, was represented by lawyer Peter Keith Fernando. The prosecution asked that the accused be remanded at Changi Medical Centre (CMC) for psychiatric observation. The police prosecutor told the court that preliminary investigations revealed that the 16-year-old had been previously assessed at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in 2019 after he had attempted to commit suicide. He had been taken into custody for his safety, referred to IMH for assessment, then discharged, the prosecutor said. “Given the circumstances, we are submitting that he requires psychiatric evaluation,” said the prosecutor. Fernando confirmed his client’s parents had informed him of this incident, which happened when the boy was in Secondary 2. The boy will be remanded at CMC for psychiatric observation and is scheduled to be in court next on Aug 10. Those found guilty of murder can receive the death penalty. However, those aged below 18 will not get the death sentence but could be given life imprisonment instead. At the mortuary at the Singapore General Hospital on Tuesday morning, a police van arrived at the compound around 8.45am. Three people dressed in black and wearing lanyards got off the vehicle carrying boxes. A second police van arrived at the mortuary about 10 minutes later. In a post on his Facebook page minutes after the boy was charged on Tuesday, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam called the incident “one of the worst things that can happen to parents”. “It’s completely shocking because safety is assumed and normally (in Singapore anyway) assured. The attacker is also a young boy, (16), he has been charged today. As (the Attorney-General’s Chambers) told the court, there is some history of mental health issues,” he wrote. He also addressed questions asked about how the boy got an axe, which the police said on Monday that they had seized. “Preliminary investigations suggests that he purchased it online. But we will know the full facts only after investigations are completed,” Shanmugam wrote. He added: “We all grieve with the parents of the boy who was killed. It’s difficult to even describe the true extent of their grief.” The police said in a statement on Monday that they arrested the 16-year-old boy, a Sec 4 student, for his suspected involvement in the death of a Sec 1 student, 13. Both boys are Singaporeans. At about 11.40am on Monday, the police were called to RVHS where officers found the younger teenager lying motionless with multiple wounds at a toilet. He was pronounced dead at the scene by a Singapore Civil Defence Force paramedic. The police said that preliminary investigations revealed that the teenagers are not known to each other. The police said on Monday they intended to seek an order from the court to remand the teenager for psychiatric assessment. On Monday, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said his ministry is rendering all possible support to the students and staff of RVHS and their families. In a Facebook post at about 4.25pm, the minister said the safety and well-being of students and staff are of paramount importance. “We are all shocked to receive news of the tragic incident at River Valley High School this morning,” he said. “We are working closely with the Singapore Police Force on the investigations, and they will be sharing more details on the case in due course.” He added that the ministry is determined to work with parents and students to keep schools safe, and have children grow up and learn together in a trusted environment. “To all our students: We will take care of you as always,” he wrote. - The Straits Times/Asia News Network ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"PETALING JAYA: Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz could be fielded as Umno's candidate for the Lembah Pantai Parliamentary constituency in the 15th General Election, says Datuk Raja Nong Chik Raja Zainal Abidin. The former Federal Territories minister said that the Finance Minister stands a chance to win in Lembah Pantai if he represented Umno and Barisan Nasional. ""He is from Lembah Pantai, his parents have lived in Bangsar and he also grew up there. But if he wants to compete, contest as a candidate under Barisan and not Perikatan Nasional,"" he was quoted as saying by Utusan Malaysia. Raja Nong Chik was referring to speculation of Tengku Zafrul being fielded in the Lembah Pantai seat. Tengku Zafrul is currently a senator and is not a member of any political party. In the same article, Raja Nong Chik also said that he would contest in the Lembah Pantai seat as an independent if his party fielded an outsider. Raja Nong Chik added that he was in favour of giving younger candidates a chance but said that they must come from the constituencies that they want to represent as they would better understand local issues. ""If you ask me to come down to give my support on the ground, I have no problem with that. But if an outsider is selected, I will contest in the upcoming general election,"" said Raja Nong Chik. ""I am willing to contest as an independent if Umno fields an outsider. There are many young candidates, it is not a problem for me to support them, it is up to the party's top leadership, but it is imperative the candidate has to be a local of Lembah Pantai,"" he added. Raja Nong Chik previously contested in the Lembah Pantai constituency in 2013 and in 2018 but lost both times. He lost to PKR's Nurul Izzah Anwar in 2018 and to PKR's Fahmi Fadzil in 2018; Nurul Izzah obtained a 1,848-vote majority in 2013 and Fahmi defeated Raja Nong Chik by 5,000 votes In the report, he also said that Umno would be able to win the Lembah Pantai seat if it could maintain its cooperation with PAS, adding that PAS has strong election machinery there. ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"One exclusive clubhouse, three top law enforcement officials, six unknown guests, a hotpot dinner with an undisclosed price tag, and   that has kept Hong Kong buzzing for the past week or so, after news broke  The questions came fast and furious: how much did the meal cost? Who paid? Who else was there? Did the three men flout codes of conduct for civil servants and office-holders, or other laws? And what about that breach of  Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with  , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. News of the dinner broke early last week in local press outlets. The officials admitted flouting the ban on gatherings of more than four people by being in the party of nine. All three were fined, and subsequently apologised.  Cheng Yuet-ngor came to their defence, asking everyone to move on and view the matter in “a more humanised way”. She acknowledged the trio’s lack of sensitivity, but noted they had paid a price in terms of being fined and taking a hit to their reputations, and said no further investigation was needed. Lam also argued the word “lavish” – used in the Civil Service Bureau’s regulations to describe the kind of meals officials ought to avoid – was fluid, without precise definition. “It was a matter of judgment,” she said. “But I would say this, it would be too harsh to say no public officers can attend social gatherings. I hope you won’t go to that extreme and suggest public officials should not go to any social gathering when invited.” The next day, Secretary for Security Chris Tang Ping-keung revealed that the hotpot dinner was pricey, without saying exactly how much it cost. But he also said price was not the only factor that mattered in such situations, and one also had to look at whether a social gathering created a conflict of interest or damaged the government’s reputation – neither of which he noted in this case. “Our colleagues did not know beforehand that the meal was as expensive as reported by some media. They also did not realise during the meal that it was so expensive,” he said. The authorities have released no information about the other guests, not even their age range or gender – details revealed routinely at police press briefings. that the breach of social-distancing rules at the March 2 dinner came to light when police were investigating a complaint by one of the guests, a woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted that night. The sources also said one of the other guests was an executive of a mainland Chinese real estate giant. Tang said he could not name the other guests, as the case was under criminal investigation, but clarified that the three officials were not involved in the probe. While legal experts doubt any bribery law was broken, observers say the lack of full and frank disclosure leaves a bad taste in the mouth. City University adjunct professor Ian Scott, who has written extensively on administrative ethics in Hong Kong, said existing protocols did allow senior officials and civil servants to attend such meals, subject to conditions Referring to the three officials, he said: “I do not know whether they paid for their meal but if they did not, it is clearly unethical.” The customs commissioner and immigration chief are regulated by the Civil Service Bureau’s rules on conduct and discipline, while Au, a political appointee, is subject to the Code for Officials under the Political Appointment System. Accepting food and drinks falls under the entertainment section of both codes. The civil service rules remind public servants not to “accept lavish, or unreasonably generous or frequent entertainment” that may give rise to conflicts of interest, put them in an obligatory duty or bring disrepute to the civil service. The code for political appointees requires officials to be mindful of “the lavish or excessive nature of the entertainment, the relationship between the official and his host, and the character or reputation of his host or known attendees”. Scott said the rules were clear about what was acceptable when civil servants played host, as there was a maximum allowance per person of HK$450 (US$58) for lunch and HK$600 for dinner. A government source who preferred to remain anonymous said problems arose only when public servants had to decide whether to accept meals and drinks as the code’s reference to lavish entertainment was abstract. “Some colleagues, fearing they may be reported or investigated, simply choose not to accept invitations.” The source said Hong Kong’s growing ties with the mainland made it harder for officials to turn down networking meals with their counterparts from across the border. It was not always possible to check menu prices in advance, he added, as most of these gatherings were held in private and paid for by their mainland counterparts. “Unless someone files a report or the meeting is exposed, outsiders would hardly know the details of what was served at the meal,” he said. Another senior government source pointed out that for some officials, their job included fostering communication with people from different sectors, including over meals. “It is impossible to demand that officials not meet anyone because of a possible conflict of interest, as everyone, to a certain extent, will be linked to government service,” he said. “As long as the official declares the relationships when handling a job that is linked to the party, I don’t see any problem.” But Scott was more concerned about the way in which the scandal was handled after it burst into the open. “I think the authorities should be more forthcoming about the circumstances,” he said. Political scientist Ivan Choy Chi-keung, from Chinese University, said: “Hong Kong has always prided itself on its corruption-free and law-abiding image internationally. The government may want to consider whether its recent approach will affect its reputation.” He added that the case highlighted what he described as a shift in the government’s attitude to handling cases of possible conflict of interest. In the past, he said, officials accused of improper behaviour were grilled by lawmakers or taken to court. “Back then, the government appeared to be more mindful of public opinion and the opposition camp would also make inquiries,” Choy said. But almost all opposition lawmakers resigned from the legislature last year, and many figures from the bloc had been arrested since the arrival of the national security law. Pro-establishment lawmaker Paul Tse Wai-chun said the law and civil service codes already set out clearly the expectations of officials. He said the spending limits for civil servants who hosted meals should also be applicable when they were guests and others picked up the tab. He disagreed with Lam’s suggestion that “lavish” was defined too vaguely in the rules. “It all comes down to the need to cultivate a better culture [among civil servants],” he added. Former director of public prosecutions Grenville Cross described the scandal as “a storm in a teacup”. “Things might be different if a civil servant accepted lavish entertainment in circumstances that compromised his position vis-à-vis the provider, and he realised this, but from what has been reported, there is nothing to suggest that is what happened here,” he said. He noted the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance criminalised the “acceptance of an advantage” without the permission of the chief executive, but excluded entertainment as being capable of amounting to an advantage. However, Simon Young Ngai-man, associate law dean of the University of Hong Kong, said the exclusion of entertainment in the law did not apply to the offence of misconduct in public office. But he added the common law offence of misconduct required proof of a wilful and serious breach of the civil servant’s public duty. “If the meal is a private unofficial gathering without any potential conflict of interest, it is unlikely to amount to a breach of duty,” he said. A senior counsel who requested anonymity agreed, but added that there was still the matter of the three officials breaching social-distancing rules, which sent the wrong signal. “The public will interpret their actions as showing that high public officials do not think they have to abide by the same rules as the general public. The officials will be judged in the court of public opinion,” he said. ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"PETALING JAYA: About 250,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines will be delivered to the Klang Valley through the Selangor Vaccine (Selvax) Industry programme. ""The supply of vaccine stocks is expected to arrive in stages from July 23 to 30. ""Stocks for the first and second doses for the initial phase amount to approximately 40,000 doses,"" said a joint statement issued by Selangor exco for trade and industry Datuk Teng Chang Kim and exco for housing, urban well-being and entrepreneur development Rodziah Ismail on Monday night (July 19). They said the supply comes under ""Operation Surge Capacity"" which aims to speed up vaccination of adults in the greater Klang Valley. Selvax is divided into two categories, Community (free for targeted groups) and Industry. Under Selvax Industry, companies and industries can register for vaccination but must bear the RM350 cost per employee for both doses. Some 2.9 million employees from 62,000 companies signed up for Selvax Industry when it opened for registration in mid-June. Teng and Rodziah said the move to speed up vaccination in Selangor and the Klang Valley is in line with the decision taken by National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme coordinating minister Khairy Jamaluddin and Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari during a recent meeting. The vaccines, Teng and Rodziah added, would be administered at five mega PPVs and health facilities set up for the purpose. The PPVs are Tropicana Gardens Mall, Evo Mall in Kota Damansara, Hotel De Palma in Bandar Baru Bangi, Arora Place in Shah Alam, the PKNS Sports Complex in Bukit Jalil, as well as Selcare panel clinics. ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"Recent air force sorties by the People’s Liberation Army near   may be training its pilots in new combat tactics, with a key role for the J-16 fighter bomber helped by early warning and electronic warfare aircraft, analysts said. Military observers have noted an increased presence of the KJ-500 airborne early warning and control system (Awacs) and different generations of fighter jets, along with the multi-role J-16, during the PLA’s numerous approaches towards the self-ruled island in recent months. The Y-8 series of anti-submarine and electronic warfare planes have also been involved in the intensified fly-by combinations, as well as J-11, J-10 and J-7 fighters and H-6 bombers, reaching a record 28 aircraft that entered Taiwan’s air defence zone on  Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with  , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. The PLA has been conducting island encirclement exercises since the 2016 re-election of Taiwanese president Tsai-Ing-wen from the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland, by force if necessary. Lu Li-shih, a former instructor at the Taiwanese Naval Academy in Kaohsiung, said the aircraft groupings showed the PLA was trying out a new tactic of cooperative and engagement capability (CEC) – inspired by the US military – which connects and shares information between the different combat platforms, with each one performing different roles during an engagement. “In the PLA’s CEC scenarios, the KJ-500s may take responsibility for finding hostile targets, and then share the information with the J-16s to let the latter hit enemies because the Awacs aircraft themselves do not carry any weapons,” he said. “Those incursions made by the KJ-500, J-15 and other aircraft around Taiwan appear to just have the island as their key target, but they mean the PLA is now able to challenge the US’s archipelagic defence strategy under its Indo-Pacific policy,” Lu said. “It is necessary for the US to help Taiwan enhance its electronic warfare and electromagnetic spectrum operations capabilities ... to prevent Beijing’s further military expansion in the region.” Macau-based military expert Antony Wong Tong said the J-16 was specifically designed for a possible Taiwan attack, but needed to fight alongside the PLA’s current sole active J-20 stealth fighter and the J-10C lightweight fighter jet. “The J-16 was developed to fill the gaps and any blindness left by the J-20s and other older generation fighter jets in dogfights,” Wong said. “The heavyweight fighter is a 4.5 generation jet intended to rival the US’s F-35A Lighting II, with a unit price of up to US$80 million.” Wong said it was clear from academic journals published on the mainland that the PLA navy was already applying CEC principles between its most advanced 12,000 tonne Type 055 stealth guided missile destroyer and its smaller, less sophisticated Type 052D guided missile destroyer.  Like the J-20 and the J-10C, the J-16s are equipped with home-grown WS-10B engines, making them suitable for mass production. The multi-role J-16 fighter bomber made its secret maiden flight on October 17 2011, nine months after the PLA’s only active stealth fighter jet – the high-profile J-20 Mighty Dragon – was unveiled while then US defence secretary Robert Gates was meeting former Chinese president Hu Jintao in Beijing on January 11 of that year. , development of the J-16 began in the early 2010s, as the US air force unveiled upgrades to its F-15C/D Eagle fighter jet – key rival of China’s J-11B – to equip it with a computer-controlled active electronically scanned array (AESA). The new technology, with its high jamming resistance to allow ships and aircraft to radiate powerful radar signals, doubled the vision and strike range of the Eagle, while retaining its stealth capability. It also pushed forward development of China’s J-16 based fourth generation aircraft platform, with almost all US fighters in the Asia-Pacific region equipped with the powerful technology. In an interview aired by state broadcaster CCTV in March, PLA flying instructor Wang Songxi described the J-16 as a warplane “without flaws” because of its ability to carry a wide range of weapons, including air-to-air, air-to-ship and air-to-ground and radar-guided beyond-visual-range missiles. In the same programme, J-16 pilot Bai Long highlighted its stealth capability. “The greatest advantage of the J-16 is its ability to find the enemy and take pre-emptive strikes, but the rival would not be able to respond, just because of its high invisibility,” he said. ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): Laden with an ice box, needles, personal protective equipment and other items, the team of volunteers and medical officers stepped out of their van on a narrow kampung road in Beranang, Selangor, one hot Tuesday morning recently. ""At least the rain has stopped,"" mused a volunteer as the six-person group made their way uphill on a dirt road. It was uncomfortably humid and the equipment they carried was heavy but that trip on July 6 was necessary to protect bedridden and disabled people – those who are unable to go to Covid-19 vaccination centres (PPV). It was the first day of the door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination programme by medical non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as Mercy Malaysia, Islamic Medical Association of Malaysia Response & Relief Team and the National Cancer Society, aided by the Social Welfare Department (JKM) and the Health Ministry. The success of the programme means expansion to other hard-to-reach communities, such as those in the interior, the Orang Asli, the stateless and refugees. ""Today is very important to us because we would like to know the flow of the work and what the challenges are so we can work it out,"" said Dr Mohammad Iqbal Omar, head of Mercy Malaysia's health unit. Their first stop was at Kampung Kuala Pajam and the first home to receive this service was that of an elderly man recovering from a stroke, and four family members. Once at the house, Dr Mohammad Iqbal gave the family a briefing on the Covid-19 vaccine, Pfizer-BioNTech in this instance, and possible complications before asking for their medical history and consent to be vaccinated. He and the medical assistant then reconstituted the vaccine. The vaccine has a shelf life of two hours at room temperature, and they had no time to waste. After giving the family their shots, the team updated their vaccine status on the JKM database and monitored the recipients for 15 minutes for any adverse reaction. Then, they made their way to the next house, about five kilometres away. The houses in Beranang and Semenyih are set far apart and the common mode of transport is the motorcycle. There are few vans and cars on the narrow road and should a motorist encounter another vehicle, it takes careful manoeuvring in order not to brush against it. The team expects to repeat the vaccination process for 22,000 homebound people as well as their caregivers in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. Dr Mohammad Iqbal said inoculations would continue until everyone is covered. Expansion of the programme means the situation will get more challenging rather than easier. Despite a slow start to Malaysia's National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, mass vaccination efforts have increased in the past few weeks, surpassing the daily 400,000 dose target as of July 12. Covid-19 cases, however, have also been breaking records with 13,215 daily cases reported on July 15. With the advent of more transmissible variants and uneven application of health restrictions, the government and public health experts have pinned their hopes on vaccines to return the country to some semblance of normalcy. Malaysia plans to vaccinate at least 80% of adults, including non-citizens, in order to return to a semblance of normal. For now, the door-to-door programme is for Malaysian citizens registered with JKM, and not necessarily with MySejahtera. The organisers hope to expand the programme to other underserved communities and generate their own database, which would be linked to the programme and will include those who are unable to register for vaccines due to technological, geographical or bureaucratic barriers. As the door-to-door programme also includes vaccination for all adults within the household, the organisers hope it will help those who would not come forward for a shot under normal circumstances. Experts agree reducing red tape would help increase coverage, but some form of registration should still occur to facilitate vaccine distribution, keep track of adverse events and follow up on the doses. ""In an ideal world, we can allow people to register on the spot and vaccinate without being too thorough with the documentation,"" said Datuk Dr Ahmad Faizal Mohd Perdaus, president of Mercy Malaysia. Particularly challenging would be those who are unable to register for vaccines due to citizenship issues. This group includes the stateless, refugees and irregular migrants. Although Malaysia is no stranger to vaccinating these communities, such as during last year's wild polio outbreak in Sabah, mass vaccinating them against Covid-19 is a brand new challenge. Dr Ahmad Faizal said Covid-19 vaccinations could not rely on the framework of previous vaccination drives as the situations are not comparable. ""Covid-19 is a first for vaccines as the priority for vaccination is the elderly, not children,"" he said. Government agencies and NGOs are currently reaching out to people in the interior, Orang Asli villages and rural areas to create awareness and register them for the vaccine. Mobile vaccination sites have also been deployed to these areas to administer the shots. However, this setup has not been without issues. Some have refused to sign up during registration drives. Several signed up but did not show up for their vaccine, while others were turned away for not having an identification card. Datuk Isa Ab Hamid, the senator representing Orang Asli affairs in the Dewan Negara, said one way to fix the issues is to empower village and community leaders with registering and vouching for their charges who may not possess proper documentation. ""We can ask the village chief to verify the person because he knows who is Orang Asli and who isn't, and who the parents are,"" he said. ""We don't want anyone to fall between the cracks and become the cause for the virus to spread among the Orang Asli community,"" he added. He said those without proper identification would not go to vaccination sites due to fear and shame. As such, he hoped the home visit programme would be able to service them, adding that it should happen sooner rather than later to protect everyone. Other than community leaders, another way to register the underserved communities is by collecting and using other identification information of theirs, according to Wong Chun Ting, national project officer for Public Health and Migration at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). ""For the undocumented population, what we can do is collect the minimum information like age, phone number, gender and sex. There are also Malaysians who don't have phone numbers and documentation as well so the way we do it is to generate a different unique number for registration purposes,"" he said. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and local NGO Development of Human Resources in Rural Areas, Malaysia has one of the highest numbers of stateless people in the region. At last count, there were 12,400 stateless people in Peninsular Malaysia alone. There is no estimate for the stateless in Sabah and Sarawak. As for irregular migrants, IOM puts the figure at between one and three million people in Malaysia while over 170,000 refugees are registered with UNHCR. Dr Ahmad Faizal stressed the importance of vaccinating everyone regardless of citizenship status. ""In the time of the pandemic, it is more or less an issue of human rights now. You have to accord them the same treatment, you have to do the same testing, you have to vaccinate everyone,"" he said. ""We cannot ignore the non-citizen population. We do so to our detriment."" – Bernama ​​​​​​​IN films and fashion, the surest signifier of a celebrity status is being known by just one name: Marilyn, Audrey, Twiggy, Kate.

"The only way so many patrons and staff could get affected at former KTV outlets that had supposedly pivoted to serving only food and drinks is that laws had been flouted.- ST  SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): There is an ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases, with 480 people getting infected over the past week. This exceeds the total number of infections reported over the previous month. Most of the new cases can be traced either to the cluster linked to KTV lounges, or to the one at Jurong Fishery Port. The two clusters are linked, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in a Facebook post on Monday (July 19). Both clusters are of concern - but for different reasons. The KTV cluster has 192 cases linked to it so far. The number will probably continue to increase for some time, since it is quite likely that some who have been infected would prefer to lie low, and hence continue the chain of transmission. The reason some KTV patrons may not get themselves tested is also the reason why this cluster is so disappointing, from Singapore's perspective. This has nothing to do with moral issues, which are personal to individuals. The only way so many patrons and staff could get affected at former KTV outlets that had supposedly pivoted to serving only food and drinks is that laws have been flouted. Had they been followed, with two patrons seated at each table and no intermingling between tables - and certainly not with hostesses - it is unlikely there would be close to 200 cases in such a short time. The presence of hostesses itself is telling. Why would a regular food and beverage (F&B) outlet need hostesses? In other words, hundreds of people broke the laws - while a pandemic was still raging - with little regard for their own health, the health of their families and friends, and the nation's efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. These are the proprietors of the lounges, their staff and patrons. It is because of these people that the whole nation is now facing stricter measures. The authorities, too, should have kept a sharper eye on these establishments. The multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19 decided to allow nightspots to pivot to F&B outlets to help them earn enough to pay their rents and their staff. But, on deeper reflection, surely there should have been questions about whether it was viable for former KTV lounges to function as F&B outlets. Or whether all of them really wanted to keep their end of the bargain. Most of these places do not have kitchens that can serve hot food. This means they would likely serve drinks and snacks, just as they did when they were nightspots. How many patrons would turn up with one friend to have a drink and snacks, and leave within the hour? Furthermore, many karaoke lounges have small individual rooms. There were also open bars crammed with patrons in pre-Covid-19 days. How many spaced-out tables can they accommodate? Given these red flags, shouldn't such places have been more closely monitored for breaches? Finance Minister and task force co-chairman Lawrence Wong had explained: ""Each time you do an enforcement check, there is a little bit of cat and mouse going on, because the enforcement officers come in... the people who are breaking the rules will be on the lookout, they see someone coming in and then they may start to adjust, and respond accordingly."" That is true, of course. But it just means that to catch the mouse, the cat has to be smarter. If it was possible for people to run out the back door, someone should have been waiting there to nab them. It is also likely that the Covid-19 enforcement officers used for such inspections lacked the experience needed in such circumstances. A police blitz on Saturday (July 17) against unlicensed public entertainment outlets resulted in the arrest of three men, while 36 others are being investigated for possibly breaching Covid-19 rules. So why weren't the police monitoring these pivoted nightspots all along? Yes, there are hundreds of nightspots, so the task is not an easy one. But catching and exposing such breaches, including throwing the book at them, would have served as a warning to others. The fact that a police operation after the emergence of the KTV cluster was able to nab 39 potential law-breakers is telling in itself - since infringements continued even after the KTV transmission was made public. While enforcement is not easy, it will be necessary, if pivoted nightspots that follow the rules are to be allowed to continue with their business. The cluster that emerged from the Jurong Fishery Port is a different story altogether. There appears to be no major legal breaches here - though some of those who were infected are believed to have patronised KTV outlets - and either spread the virus into that susceptible community, or brought it to the wholesale market. And yet, because of this cluster, more than a dozen wet markets and foodcourts have had to be closed and deep cleaned. The virus likely spread to these places through people buying fish at the wholesale market and selling them at wet markets or cooked food stalls. On Monday (July 19), another 106 infected people were diagnosed and linked to this cluster, more than doubling the number to 169. Safety measures are not foolproof. Neither does vaccination provide 100 per cent protection. So transmission can occur even if all is adhered to. But again, there were probably breaches in safety measures for the virus to have spread so widely and so quickly. These are more likely to be unintended breaches, such as masks not properly covering faces, or reused too many times, or being wet and thus not protecting against the virus. Or someone could have touched surfaces where the virus lurked and then touched their own face without washing or sanitising their hands properly. And who could blame stallholders concentrating on their work, or shoppers looking for the best deals, possibly in hot and sweaty conditions? In a sense, this offers a peek into what accepting Covid-19 as endemic will mean to Singapore, especially if the rate of vaccination remains low among seniors. Ong said in his post: ""It reflects the transmissibility of the Delta variant."" Over the past month, 96 per cent of cases here were infected with this more transmissible variant. On Sunday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) urged all unvaccinated seniors to stay home as much as possible for the next few weeks, to avoid getting infected by the growing clusters, since their risk of getting seriously ill is far higher than that of someone who has been vaccinated. People who want to see more measures eased should first help convince any older acquaintances to get vaccinated. According to the MOH data, of the 465 people infected over the last four weeks, the 135 who had been fully vaccinated were all either asymptomatic or showed only mild symptoms. This is regardless of their age. True, among the 185 who were infected but not vaccinated, 96 per cent also had mild or no symptoms. But about one in 25 needed oxygen or intensive care. All but one who needed intensive care over the past four weeks, as well as the vast majority of those who needed oxygen - in other words, those who were seriously ill - were aged 60 years and older. Today, just slightly more than seven in 10 people aged 70 years and older are protected by vaccines. In other words, the group that is most at risk has the lowest take-up rate among all vaccine-eligible age groups. Unless this improves, there is a real risk of hospital beds filling up and people dying when measures are eased once the majority of people here are vaccinated by next month. Professor Ooi Eng Eong, a microbiologist at the Duke-NUS Medical School, said: ""The Delta variant is a lot more infectious. Measures that worked in the past may not be as effective."" With a transmission rate of 5 to 8, in other words, one infected person is likely to infect between five and eight people who are not vaccinated (those who have been vaccinated may get infected, but the rate would be much lower), Prof Ooi said vaccination is the best strategy. That was how smallpox, with a similar transmission rate, was controlled. Today, about 2.7 million people, or roughly half the population, have been fully vaccinated, with another 1.5 million partially vaccinated. Singapore plans to ease restrictions once two-thirds of people here are fully vaccinated. So time is running out for the one million eligible people still dithering over whether to get vaccinated. - The Straits Times/Asia News Network LAW graduates have many career options.

"PETALING JAYA: A doctor says Malaysians need to treat everyone they encounter in their daily lives as Covid-19 positive, so they should increase the precautions they take. In a video clip posted on Facebook and Instagram on Friday (July 16) after what she described as a ""long, tiring, exhausting day at work, Dr Dhivya Dhyana said it was best for everyone to ""stay away from everyone"" else until the number of cases reduces. As an example, she shared an account of her encounter with a 90-year-old Covid-19 patient at the public hospital in Selangor where she serves. ""Yesterday, she succumbed to the illness and passed away. A day before that, we found out that her son – who was also positive – was in the same ward and nobody knew ... They were admitted at different times and brought in separately. ""The family at home was not sure which wards they were in,"" she said, adding that the wards are huge and have many patients. She said the son only had one day to be with his mother before she died. Dr Dhivya said even more upsetting was when she learnt that three others from the same family were in the same hospital but in different wards. ""None of them knew they were admitted to the same hospital. By the time we found out (they were related), many of them were already at the late stage,"" she said, adding that hospitals do not always have time to identify families with hundreds of patients coming in every day. Further checks showed that the five family members did not live in the same house but had a birthday gathering recently. ""Everyone thinks it's okay to just visit for a while, or 'I'm just gonna visit my friend for 10 minutes' or 'I'll just pass this to my neighbour'. ""All these small things which we think are harmless are causing the bigger problem,"" she said. ""Whether it's your neighbour, the food delivery rider, the aunty that you go for walks with, your friends or family, anyone can be Covid-19 positive. So you have to stick with that mentality. ""At this point, there's no reason for anyone to go out unless you are a frontliner, there is an emergency or someone is literally dying,"" Dr Dhivya, who was the 2016 Miss Universe Malaysia first runner-up, said in the video. The 10-minute video has been viewed over 300,000 times and widely shared on social media. She also said that the number of patients brought in dead at the hospital has increased, with some suddenly collapsing for unknown reasons and later testing positive for Covid-19. According to her, hospitals were overwhelmed, with wait times for beds stretching to days. Due to the high number of admissions, families are often unable to get hold of relatives to find out how they are faring, she added. ""When they are taken to the hospital, you just don't know if that's the last time you will see them,"" she said. Dr Dhivya also said patients who came to the hospital for non-Covid-19-related emergencies were unable to get treatment because of the overwhelming number of Covid-19 cases and a lack of resources. ""It has come to the point where we are choosing who we can save... who we can ventilate,"" she claimed. ""If the numbers continue rising, I really don't know what's going to happen,"" she said, adding that everyone should just stay at home. She said it was easy to say the system has failed or the rules and regulations were not what they should be. ""But what are we doing as the people to flatten the curve? I don't think we're doing enough because everyone is still out and about,"" she said. LAW graduates have many career options. The most obvious is in the legal profession as an advocate and solicitor.

"FRIED durians are selling like hotcakes, thanks to the creativity of two sisters in Perak. Nor Faizatul Shawani Abu Bakar, 31, and Nor Farhana Fatihah, 24, would dip slices of durians in batter and fry them, Kosmo! reported. Each piece is sold for RM1 at their stall in Sungai Siput. They started their venture on July 1, selling fried bananas. They then decided to expand to selling fried durians as the King of Fruits’ season had started in the state. The sisters use durian kampung dipped in a batter mixture they learned from their mother. “We didn’t expect fried durian to catch on. We started with selling 100 pieces a day but now we sell up to 300 daily,” said Nor Farhana. > Actress Hanna Aqeela is not afraid of a little competition from new talents, especially with more “Instafamous” actors making their way to the big screen, Harian Metro reported. “I like to improve my skills to stay ahead of the competition,” she said. Hanna said she has come a long way since she started eight years ago. “Experience has been a good teacher. A director once scolded me for my poor acting skills but I kept working to perfect my craft. All the hard work has been worth it,” she said. > The daily also reported that a father’s hope of welcoming his first daughter was dashed when Covid-19 claimed the lives of both his pregnant wife and their unborn child.

He took her to the hospital where she died later of Covid-19. The general worker for a used car business said his family was looking forward to the new addition and his two young sons would often rub their mother’s belly. “I’ve run out of ways to explain to them about their mother’s death.

"Women and a child walk by a billboard calling on people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 outside a shopping mall in Beijing, capital of China, on May 24, 2021. - AP BEIJING (China Daily/ANN): Sinopharm's Covid-19 vaccine has been approved for emergency use for young people ages 3 to 17, after early and midstage clinical trials showed it is safe and can elicit strong immune responses in the age group, the company said in a recent statement. The approval was granted by the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council, which was set up to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. It is the second domestic Covid-19 vaccine made available for children and teenagers in China. In June, Sinovac Biotech's vaccine was authorised for emergency use for young people. Sinopharm said in a statement released on Friday that it had completed the first and second stages of clinical trials in Henan province on people ages 3 to 17, which showed their vaccine was effective and safe. All trial participants had generated antibodies to tackle the virus after receiving two doses. There were no significant differences in the strength of their immunity when compared with adult counterparts. The vaccine showed good safety and no severe adverse effects had been recorded, the company said. ""We began clinical trials among adolescents by first testing 13- to 17-year-olds, then proceeding to 6-to 12-year-olds and 3- to 5-year-olds, so as to guarantee safety,"" said Zhang Yuntao, chief scientist and vice-president of Sinopharm's China National Biotech Group, during an interview with China National Radio. The company said it also launched a study in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on June 6, to evaluate the vaccine's efficacy in a group of 900 people of different nationalities ages 3 to 17. Vaccinating children and teens is essential to building an immunity barrier against the virus, Zhang said. Young people's immune systems are still developing, so researchers are careful when involving them in clinical trials, he said. Zhang said it will likely take another year for the vaccine to receive full market approval from the nation's top drug regulator for use in younger people. Sinovac also reported encouraging results from the first and second stage clinical trials of its vaccine on 552 people ages 3 to 17 in Hebei province, conducted from October to December. According to results published in The Lancet medical journal in late June, its vaccine had elicited antibody responses in over 96 per cent of trial participants, on par with the rate in trials involving adults. Liu Peicheng, a spokesman for Sinovac, said the vaccines administered to children and teens are identical to those delivered to adults. ""There is no need to take extra precautions when inoculating children,"" he added. Last week, several cities in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and Fujian and Hebei provinces announced they will begin administering Covid-19 vaccines to teenagers ages 12 to 17, with some cities saying they will complete the inoculations by the end of September or October. Since then, more than a dozen provincial-level regions have announced similar plans. Beijing is taking surveys and rolling out publicity campaigns in preparation for the start of its vaccination programme for teenagers after September, community workers told the newspaper Health Times. - China Daily/Asia News Network LAW graduates have many career options.

"PUTRAJAYA: Encouraged by the positive development concerning the national vaccination rate, slight changes have been made to the standard operating procedure under Phases One and Two of the National Recovery Plan, which, among others, allow for the public to partake in individual cycling and games. Changes in SOP under Phase One allow for these recreational activities to be done with physical distancing of two to three metres but in the neighbourhood or surrounding area. Operating hours for public and daily markets have been extended from 6am to 4pm depending on local authorities with SOP to be monitored by Rela or local council officers, whereas operating hours for controlled fresh markets are from 7am to 2pm. Announcing this, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said to boost productivity, presence at offices for the public sector would be increased to 40% and is subject to orders and directives by the Chief Secretary to the Government. He also said that accounts services would be allowed to operate at 60% capacity now. “The changes are made following positive development to our vaccination rate,” he said yesterday. Ismail Sabri, however, did not state when the slightly relaxed SOP would take effect. “Ports, airports and the logistics sector in areas under Phase One will be permitted to operate 24 hours while mining and quarry activities can increase workers’ capacity to a maximum of 60%. “This is to meet demand from critical projects involving construction and repair works for roads, including rural roads,” he said.

"PETALING JAYA: There has been overwhelming demand for Covid-19 home self-test kits, say retail pharmacies. The response from online and offline sales has been great, said BIG Pharmacy marketing manager Liew Chui Ying. “Customers have walked in to ask about them and also there are enquiries via online platforms or our official WhatsApp number. The sales are overwhelming and we believe it will continue to grow further,” she said when contacted yesterday. These kits, she said, will be available for purchase at selected BIG Pharmacy stores from today, subject to availability. Due to limited supply, she said some stores may not be getting sufficient stock based on pre-orders. As such, priority will be given to pre-orders. “Customers can walk in for pre-order registration or order online on our official web store,” said Liew. At the moment, BIG Pharmacy is only carrying the Gmate Saliva Antigen Kits at a cost of RM39.90 each but its team will continue to explore other brands and suppliers. “This test kit is offering a convenience for anyone who wishes to test if they are infected. “They can do it safely at their home without going out to expose themselves or spread the virus since the accuracy is high at 96% based on 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity,” she said. Caring Pharmacy Retail Management Sdn Bhd head of procurement, health, beauty and own brands category Foo Fung Jiun also said the demand for the Covid-19 self-test kits has been “overwhelming”. “Most of our stores will have the test kits by Wednesday,” he said. Foo noted that there are currently two self-test kit brands approved by the Medical Device Authority. “The Gmate Saliva Antigen Kits (Home Use) is one of them. For the other brand, we are still in the midst of discussion with the supplier,” he said. The Gmate Saliva Antigen Kits is selling at Caring for RM39.90 each and RM219.60 for six. Malaysian Pharmacists Society president Amrahi Buang said: “The self-test kits are going to be a game changer in the new normal. “It can be widely used for mass events to ensure the status of the participants. It will also be relevant for manufacturers, factories and shop outlets if they are required to screen their employees periodically,” he said. Amrahi said it will also be useful for testing in schools and universities. LAW graduates have many career options. The most obvious is in the legal profession as an advocate and solicitor.

"MUTTON bone curry is one of the classic Malay dishes usually prepared for the family. It is seldom served to guests as the dish does not contain much meat. Mutton is quite an expensive ingredient, so it makes sense to make the best use of every part of the meat. When mutton bones are aplenty during this period of qurban (sacrificial rites), many households cook this dish to use up the offcuts and tendons. The use of bones also gives the gravy more flavour and body, especially if you use bone that contains a lot of marrow. It is best to get a variety of bone parts so that you get a good mixture of meat, tendon and marrow — all in one dish. You can ask your butcher to cut up a medley of bones such as ribs, shank, spine and shoulder to cater to everyone’s favourite mutton parts. Because the spice blend is also quite simple to prepare, I don’t usually buy pre-packaged spices. Grinding fresh ones in an electric mill results in a curry that truly tastes home-cooked. The only ready-made ingredient that I use is kerisik (toasted grated coconut). You may omit this if it is unavailable, or if you do not like the taste. I personally prefer my curry gravy to be smooth and creamy, and I find the gravy texture a bit coarse and gritty when there is kerisik in the curry. Families who prepare this dish usually make a big pot of it because it can withstand prolonged cooking and keeps well. In fact, it tastes even better the next day when the flavours of the spices have penetrated into the meat. Blend spice paste ingredients in an electric mill into a smooth paste. Heat oil in a heavy-bottom pot. Temper curry leaves, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and star anise in hot oil until fragrant. Add spice paste and sauté until dry and fragrant. Add curry powder and chilli powder and toss until oil starts to separate. Add mutton bones and toss in curry paste until completely coated. Add asam gelugur, coconut milk, kerisik, water, salt and sugar to taste. Cover with a lid and simmer over low heat for two hours, stirring constantly to keep from burning. If using a pressure cooker, pressurise on high for 40 minutes. Depressurise when done, then add red chillies and simmer for about 5 minutes to reduce the liquid into a thick gravy. Serve with steamed rice. HELP University offers two Foundation programmes: the Foundation in Arts and Foundation in Science. LAW graduates have many career options.

"GEORGE TOWN: Penang police have arrested 49 men in connection with the incident where hundreds of foreigners allegedly performed prayers outside a surau in Taman Pelangi on Tuesday morning (July 20). Penang police chief Comm Datuk Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain said of those detained, 48 were from Bangladesh and one was a local. The men were allegedly performing Hari Raya Aidiladha prayers outside a surau during Phase Two of the National Recovery Plan in Penang. Earlier, Comm Shuhaily said the group had allegedly gone to the surau for prayers on the morning of Hari Raya Haji but they were denied entry as the limit of 100 people was reached. They then allegedly proceeded to perform their prayers on a road in front of the surau, which is near the Taman Pelangi flats in Auto City, Juru. ""The surau management had asked them to disperse and locked the gate to prevent further entry. ""As the surau respected the sensitivity of those who wanted to perform prayers and the incident happened spontaneously, it did not inform the police about the numbers outside,” he said. Comm Shuhaily added that despite the group practising physical distancing, police will still track them down to facilitate investigation under Section 269 of the Penal Code for a negligent act that could spread an infectious disease as well as movement without permission, Section 270 of the Penal Code for spreading harmful infection and the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 (Act 342) (Measures in Communicable Areas) Regulations 2020. He said no action would be taken against the surau operator as he had complied with SOP. Meanwhile, Comm Shuhaily said the neighbourhood comprised about 8,000 people living in 23 blocks of flats of which about 70% of them are foreigners working in nearby factories. The area is just 2.5km away from the Taman Nagasari neighbourhood which was placed under a 14-day enhanced movement control order that ended on July 17. Those who wish to report on SOP violations can contact the police directly at 04-222 1722. HELP University offers two Foundation programmes: the Foundation in Arts and Foundation in Science.

"PORT DICKSON (Bernama): The body of a coal lorry driver, whose vehicle plunged into the sea at the Jimah Power Plant coal unloading jetty here, early Monday (July 19) morning, was found floating off the coast of Bagan Lalang at about 4pm on Tuesday. State Fire and Rescue Department’s Operations and Station Management branch head, Mohd Hafiz Ahmad Termizi, said that the body of Sharul Nizwan Said, 33, fully clothed, was found about 2.5km from the scene by the search and rescue (SAR) team. He said that the second day of the SAR operation continued at 8am on Tuesday, with several strategies including underwater and surface searches, with all efforts conducted according to standard operating procedures. ""In terms of the physical injuries, we are still waiting for confirmation of the report from the hospital,” he told reporters at the scene here on Tuesday. However, he said that a three-tonne lorry driven by the victim, which was found on the seabed at about 11.23am on Monday, was still in the process of being lifted, due to its heavy load and strong currents. The body was taken to the Forensic Department, Port Dickson Hospital for post-mortem, and the search operation ended at 5.15pm. The SAR operation involved more than 60 personnel from various agencies, including the police, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency and the Malaysia Civil Defence Force, as well as two Fire and Rescue Department's tracking dogs. In the 1.30am incident on Monday, Sharul Nizwan was feared drowned after the coal-laden lorry he was driving reversed and plunged into the sea while he and four other friends were cleaning up the coal yard at the jetty.- Bernama HELP University offers two Foundation programmes: the Foundation in Arts and Foundation in Science.

"WHEN US president Dwight Eisenhower visited Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle near Edinburgh in 1959, he was served drop scones. It was supposedly prepared by the queen herself using a family recipe, which she later enclosed to the president in a letter. It now resides in the US National Archives. You can see the facsimile of the actual recipe at www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2011/nr11-116.html If you have ever baked scones before, you will understand why many people are apprehensive about making this finicky treat. You must not overwork the dough or it will become tough; underworked, and it will be too crumbly; overbaked and it will become dry; underbaked and it will not rise fully. However, drop scones are more forgiving because it is almost like making pancakes in a frying pan. In fact, they are also known as Scotch pancakes, and are quite popular throughout Scotland. The first time I made drop scones was when I was taught in school, and I remember how unlike scones they were. The batter was quite runny and the scones were only about half-a-centimetre thick, nothing like the ones we get in Cameron Highlands. However, this recipe from Queen Elizabeth does produce drop scones that resemble the baked scones that we know. Its stiff batter holds itself up when fried in the pan and it’s a joy to watch them rise when you flip them over. The rising is attributed to baking powder, an English invention that gave rise to many British delights. Although the original recipe calls for two teaspoons of baking soda and three teaspoons of cream of tartar, you may substitute with five teaspoons or 40g of double acting baking powder. I like to keep each dollop of batter quite small, so a tablespoon of batter is enough to give you scones of about 5cm in diameter. The finished drop scone will only rise to about 2cm in height so don’t expect scones that you can split across the middle, although there will be a noticeable crack between the tops and bottoms of the pancakes. You may eat it as a teatime treat with clotted cream or butter and strawberry jam, just like baked scones. Or you may try a more savoury alternative by topping it with sour cream and caviar, a decadent option that is evocative of Russian caviar pancakes. Queen Elizabeth’s drop scones topped with sour cream and caviarBatter400g all-purpose flour MethodSift together flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and pour in the milk. Add eggs and melted butter, and whisk together until combined. Heat a non-stick frying pan on medium heat. Brush the pan with a little cooking oil. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter on the frying pan to form pancakes. When bubbles start to appear on the surface after about two minutes, flip the pancakes over and cook for another minute or two until lightly browned. Remove from the pan and cover with a tea towel to keep warm while you cook the rest of the drop scones. Drop scones are usually eaten with clotted cream and strawberry jam. But as a savoury alternative, top with one teaspoon of sour cream and half-a-teaspoon of caviar garnished with lemon zest for scones with a hint of decadence.

"Parmigiano-Reggiano refers to cheese made in a specific Italian region whereas Parmesan sometimes isn’t even 100% cheese! — PIXABAY You are at the supermarket and a recipe you’re shopping for calls for rutabagas. Don’t see any? Can you substitute turnips? While you’re thinking about that, you’ve also been asked to pick up some condensed milk. Isn’t that really just the same as evaporated milk? The answers to those and other vexing kitchen-based questions can all be found in the insightful book  Author Brette Warshaw wades into the potentially fraught worlds of jam versus jelly, broth and stock, the various types of regional barbeque, pie versus tart, and the potentially combustible differences between grinders, heroes, hoagies and subs. “I feel like this hopefully can help fill in the gaps for people, ” she said. “And even if they do know the difference, hopefully there’s some other fun facts they can take away to make their knowledge more well-rounded.” The entries – nicely illustrated by Sophia Foster-Dimino – are short and tight, showing off Warshaw’s journalist roots, and sometimes betraying the author’s opinion. Take her entry on Parmesan versus Parmigiano-Reggiano. The latter is strictly regulated and refers to cheese from a specific Italian region, while the former has looser standards and doesn’t even have to be 100% cheese. She notes grated supermarket Parmesan can have cellulose, an anti-clumping agent made from wood pulp. “To me, what felt egregious about the whole situation is that all sorts of stuff could be passing as Parmigiano-Reggiano and it’s definitely not the same thing, ” she said. “I definitely whip out opinions sometimes and that felt like an appropriate place.” But she’s not being judgy. Her fiancé has been known to sprinkle some grated Parmesan on his pizza and she says that’s OK: “The crime is not actually eating it. If you want to eat it and you like it, no judgment there.” Sometimes Warshaw’s research discovered no difference between commonly confused items. Readers may be shocked to discover that button, cremini and Portobello mushrooms are all the same type of mushroom. Or they may be stunned to find out that shrimp and prawns are completely different creatures but pretty much taste the same. “That’s an interesting one, where it’s like there is definitely a difference. But, in the end, it kind of doesn’t matter.” The book emerged from a newsletter Warshaw started in 2018 which addresses the differences between all kinds of things, like how sea lions and seals are not the same and why balconies are not terraces. It started with a simple question. “I had been debating with friends about the difference between a sweet potato and a yam and realized I didn’t know the difference, ” she says. “I was kind of upset by that.” Warshaw turns out to be a person who finds a gap in her knowledge and really doesn’t walk away, shrugging. “I did a little bit of research and then realized how many other questions I had that were of the what’s-the-difference variety.” For the book, Warshaw concentrated on food and beverages, leaning on her own food knowledge that she’d built up at stints working at Food52 and  Karen Rinaldi, senior vice president and publisher at Harper Wave, helped convince Warshaw to focus the book as a culinary resource, calling her a creative and naturally curious person with a wide-ranging brain. Rinaldi cooks all the time and still finds things confusing, like the differences between IPA, pale ale and pilsner. The entry she most appreciates is on cobblers, crisps, buckles and crumbles: “That was the one that just delighted me because it slotted into a question that we have all the time. Now I know.” One of the exasperating questions many consumers debate is competently dealt with: What’s the difference between canola and corn oil, much less grapeseed, peanut, safflower and vegetable oils? “Something that a lot of people maybe don’t know is that any sort of neutral oil is pretty much fine for the same sort of purpose, ” she said. “I think that’s actually a difference that hopefully makes your life a bit easier – to know the basics of what you really need and what can be swapped for each other.” Oh, and for the record: Rutabagas are not the same as turnips, and don’t confuse condensed milk with evaporated milk. One never-finished entry still haunts Warshaw, the one that got away: What’s the difference between frosting, icing and glaze? It seems basic but tons of her research hasn’t produced an adequate response. “I still don’t really have the answer there or a definitive answer. The answer might be that there is no definitive answer. But that’s a tough thing to accept. So I think I’m still going to be trying to get to the bottom of that one.” – AP HELP University offers two Foundation programmes: the Foundation in Arts and Foundation in Science.

"MELAKA: The Chief Minister has asked convenience stores and restaurant operators in Ujong Pasir here not to jump to any conclusion after several residents from the Portuguese Settlement had to undergo the Covid-19 swab tests.  said this in wake of frustrations by some residents claiming that they were not allowed to enter the premises. He said it was unfair to stereotype the community by barring them from entering business premises after a few of them tested positive for the virus. ""Not all from the Settlement have tested positive for Covid-19. ""Please stop being unfair to those who are healthy and follow the standard operating procedures (SOP) by having them scan the MySejahtera to enter the premises,"" he said in an interview on Tuesday (July 20). He said it was wrong to make assumptions that everyone at the Settlement was positive for Covid-19. ""We must be more compassionate during this pandemic without sidelining anyone, just because someone from that locality tested positive for Covid-19,"" he said. The state government, said Sulaiman, would embark on immediate remedial measures if the situation in the Settlement get too serious. He said he would also ask assistance from the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to investigate the allegations that some residents were not allowed into business premises. On Tuesday, Portuguese community leaders have voiced their concerns claiming that business premises were not allowing residents to buy groceries after mass Covid-19 swab tests were conducted at the Settlement on Saturday (July 17). They said even those not wearing the Covid-19 wristbands were allegedly barred from entering the business premises. Several of the residents also vented their frustrations on Facebook.

"Children and teenagers alike are enjoying cooking and baking during the lockdown as they get to cook, eat, play with food and help their parents. — KAMPUS PRODUCTIONS/Pexels Being cooped up at home with nowhere to go and little to do is hard on young children and teenagers alike. Which is why cooking offers a fun, creative outlet that also serves as an important life skill. For young children, there is the innocence of “helping” in the kitchen. “I like cooking because I can help mummy as she is always cooking alone, ” says sweet little eight-year-old Lea Katrina Thomas. For 10-year-old Goh Hao Er, cooking during the lockdown has been something he enjoys immensely because he gets to “play with food.” Nine-year-old Trinayani Manoharan meanwhile says she loves preparing meals because she gets to eat it all up afterwards and she has something interesting to do during the lockdown. “I enjoy cooking and baking because it is very fun to make things and it’s fun to eat it also. But I don’t like the cleaning up part, although I have been helping with that too, ” she says. For older children who are able to cook independently with limited parental supervision, cooking during the lockdown has afforded a sense of pride. “I find cooking both relaxing and rewarding because I get to feed my family, which I enjoy, ” says 14-year-old Omar Faruqi. As a result of his cooking sessions during the lockdown, Omar says his skills in the kitchen have exceeded some of his friends. “I do know friends who cook better than me, but I think my basic cooking knowledge is now better than some of my friends, ” he says humbly. Nur Syadiyah Zahra, 14, meanwhile enjoys getting inventive in the kitchen when she and her older brother are tasked with cooking the family meals, something they have been doing a lot of during the lockdown. “I enjoy cooking, it’s so relaxing. And I really like how I can experiment with new meals. Like if I make fried rice, I sometimes just look at what’s in the fridge and imagine how it would taste in the dish and then I just add it in. “In that way, I have made fried rice with ingredients like mayonnaise, miso paste and even seaweed, ” she says. Arissa Elena Feizal, 11, has discovered a strong passion for baking during the lockdown, a pursuit that her parents have nurtured and encouraged. Her sweet creations like chocolate cakes, kek batik and crème caramel have since become hot ticket items among her family and friends and she even has an Instagram account @Klutzy Kid Baker to highlight her work. “Usually, when I go to school, I take some of the things I have baked and share it with my friends. So now they are always asking me to bake for them and they pay me for it too!” reveals Arissa. Arissa is also beginning to realise how useful skills like baking and cooking will be when she eventually leaves the nest. “I already know how to cook simple dishes so when I am older, I am sure I will be able to make more complicated dishes so I can survive on my own, ” she says. Arissa’s older brother Aliff Ridzuan Feizal, 16, on the other hand, has discovered how important it is to change the age-old sexist narrative surrounding cooking. “I enjoy cooking and I strongly believe that cooking is not just for girls. When you are looking for a life partner, it would be helpful to have some cooking skills and your partner will appreciate your efforts in the kitchen. And for me, I want to cook in the future with my future wife!” he says mischievously. Having had a taste of producing their own meals, many of the kids I spoke to are filled with heady dreams of cooking even more, and have compiled wish lists of things they hope to make during the rest of the lockdown or even in the future. “I want to cook Maggi mee goreng with lots of spinach, carrots, tomatoes and garlic. It’s one of my favourite things to eat so if I can cook it, I can make it for special occasions like birthdays!” says Trinayani excitedly. Arissa meanwhile says she dreams of perfecting a chocolate souffle, a pursuit that has so eluded her so far. “I tried baking it before, but it didn’t turn out quite right, so I am determined to master it, because that was my first fail as a baker, ” she says. Cheeky Goh loves eating good food and longs to get his hands on some large lobsters, which he plans to grill. “I want to cook and eat lots and lots of huge lobsters!” he says, laughing.

"MOSCOW (Reuters) -     Russia on Tuesday released what is thought to be the first footage of its advanced new S-500 surface-to-air missile system in action, a weapon it hopes will beef up its own defences and one day become an export best seller.  Its predecessor, the S-400 system, has become a source of geopolitical tension with the United States actively discouraging countries to buy it, and, in the case of Turkey, unsuccessfully trying to persuade Ankara to return it.     Footage released by the defence ministry showed the giant truck-based system's launch tubes firing a missile at high speed into the sky at a testing ground in southern Russia.  Russia's state RIA news agency said it was the first time that the defence ministry had shown the S-500 system undergoing a live fire test.   Parts of the footage had been deliberately blurred or obscured to make it harder to examine the system in detail.  The ministry said the missile had successfully hit a ""high-speed ballistic target"". ""The S-500 anti-aircraft missile system has no analogues in the world and is designed to defeat the entire spectrum of existing and promising aerospace attack weapons of a potential enemy in the entire range of altitudes and speeds,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Once the full test cycle is complete, the equipment plans provide for the delivery of the first S-500 system to the Air Defence and Missile Defence unit near Moscow,"" it said, without specifying a time frame.   The S-500 system, called Prometheus, is capable of destroying ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as planes and helicopters, and has an interception radius of around 600 km (373 miles), RIA reported. Citing Deputy Defence Minister Alexei Krivoruchko last year, RIA said the S-500 system was slated for delivery by 2025, with state contracts due to be signed this year.   Tuesday's launch took place in the southern Astrakhan region at the Kapustin Yar training range, the defence ministry said.  The test comes a day after Russia tested a Tsirkon (Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile, a weapon President Vladimir Putin has touted as part of a new generation of missile systems without equal in the world.

"Throughout the lockdown, Pang has been able to spend more time teaching Goh to cook. As a result, he is getting very creative in the kitchen and surprises his parents with his innovative meals. — PANG SIEW LING There are days when busy working mum Syuibah Abirah Mohamed Tarmizi is just too tired to cook. During this lockdown, Abirah has been working from home and her two children Muhammad Nafis Zahran, 19, and Nur Syadiyah Zahra, 14, have also been at home. To get them away from their gadgets and give them something fun and useful to do, she has deputised the task of preparing the family’s meals to her children on days when she is particularly busy. “Sometimes when I am exhausted and don’t really feel like preparing dinner, I pass it on to them. And while I normally ask them to make simple dishes like spaghetti bolognaise, I also allow them to experiment in the kitchen, provided they clean up. “This intensive cooking that the kids are doing is definitely triggered by the lockdown, because I want them to be occupied with other activities besides their gadgets and also feel a sense of accomplishment when they prepare meals for their parents, ” she says. To date, her children have made dishes as varied as burgers, spaghetti meatballs, nasi goreng kimchi and lasagna, to name a few. To keep the momentum going, Abirah and her husband continuously provide support and encouragement so their children are motivated to keep up their culinary output. Across the country, many parents like Abirah are discovering that the lockdown is a great time to really get their kids acquainted with cooking – whether it’s initiating a young child into a wonderful new world where raw ingredients are transformed into cooked meals or expanding the culinary repertoire of teenagers. So it is little wonder then that the lockdown has quickly become fertile breeding ground for budding young chefs. For stay-at-home mum Odelia Zarsadias, having her two young children – Lea Katrina Thomas, eight, and Ezra Alfred Thomas, five, running afoot at home with no avenue for outside interaction has meant she has had to figure out all sorts of creative ways to keep them occupied. Because her children are so young, Odelia has opted to get them involved in cooking in small, but meaningful ways. “My kids are always saying, ‘Mummy, I am sooo bored!’ Then my daughter will say, ‘Let’s bake or cook something.’ So I will think of something easy like cupcakes or French toasts or rainbow pasta (pasta with food colouring added to it) and will get her to do it and my son will come and have a look too. “So it’s something fun and different for them to do besides playing and fighting with each other, watching TV or doing online classes, ” says Odelia. For Bhuma Paranjothy, a doctor, cooking has been a great way to entertain her three young daughters – Trinayani Manoharan, nine, Sanskrti Manoharan, seven, and Vidhatri Manoharan, five, and lure them away from the multiple gadgets that otherwise take up most of their days. “Whatever activities they are doing now typically uses a screen – from watching TV to online classes and video calls. So cooking is something fun they can do, because they are more free now – they are not running off to school or other classes, so they have the time to explore this, ” she says. During this lockdown, Bhuma has taught both her elder daughters how to make yoghurt from scratch (the family eats yoghurt with all their meals) and is now able to call on them to make it whenever she is running out. Bhuma also allows her children to try out new recipes (with her supervision), and so they have discovered the “organised chaos” (Bhuma’s words) of making milkshakes, pancakes and waffles. As her eldest daughter Trinayani is now nine, she has started carving her own culinary path by testing out recipes on her own. “Recently Trinayani made scones entirely on her own, she looked up a recipe and followed it by herself, ” says Bhuma with pride. The industrious Bhuma also plants and grows a litany of vegetables in her home garden, including cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, cauliflower, long beans and cabbage. She has now gotten her children involved in planting and watering these vegetables during the lockdown, so that they can actively participate in and observe the growth cycle of each vegetable and how it is absorbed into different meals. “At least now they know that if they put a seed in a pot of soil and water it, it will become a vegetable or a fruit. My five-year-old now diligently waters the vegetable patch and feels so much pride that she has grown something herself. It also makes for great snacks as the kids now just go to the garden and pluck cucumbers or cherry tomatoes during their breaks from online classes, ” says Bhuma. For tuition centre owner Pang Siew Ling, the lockdown has given her the time to nurture her 10-year-old son Goh Hao Er’s prodigious interest in cooking. “You have to be very patient when cooking with children – they might be slow or make a mess. So normally when I am rushing to cook after work, I don’t really have the time to teach him. But now, I have plenty of time, ” says Pang. Pang and her son normally cook side by side and regularly whip up all sorts of meals together. She also lets him fly solo sometimes – with her supervision – so that he can get creative in the kitchen. “Sometimes he tells me he wants a particular street food, and we will make it together. And sometimes he will take charge of making fried rice or stir-fried vegetables for our dinner. At other times, he uses his creativity to invent his own food. He will say ‘Mummy, I am going to give you a surprise’ and then he will make something for us. “Every time he makes something, my husband and I make sure to give him encouraging feedback, even if the food isn’t that nice, ” says Pang, laughing. For older children, this lockdown has been a time for them to really get busy in the kitchen as many are old enough to cook on their own, with little to no guidance or supervision. Creative group head Nurul Fathma Munap says that her sporty oldest child Omar Faruqi, 14, no longer is able to play all his favourite sports, so he has turned all his energy towards cooking instead. “Omar has always been interested in cooking, but during this lockdown, he has been more adventurous and has experimented with recipes. Like recently he made a roast chicken topped with a Thai-style sauce, ” she says. Nurul says this works out perfectly for her as Omar is quite fussy, so now when he doesn’t like what she cooks, he just makes his own food instead. “The fact that he can cook his own meals is great because he doesn’t nag me to cook meals that he likes; he just cooks it himself, ” she says, laughing. Aliza Hilyati Wan Haron is a lawyer with three kids – Aliff Ridzuan Feizal, 16, Arissa Elena Feizal, 11, and Aiman Hakim Feizal, eight. Aliza says the first MCO last year forced her to cook a lot more, since dining out wasn’t possible. Once she roped in her two older children into the family’s cooking activities, she was surprised to see how interested they were in preparing meals, something that has accelerated even more during this iteration of the lockdown, when her husband has started a detailed schedule so the kids know when it is their turn to cook a family meal. “My son just likes to cook whatever he likes to eat while my daughter likes to bake. And because my family likes Western dishes, which mostly involves roasting or grilling, it’s easier for the kids to pick it up. “I had to go to the supermarket a few weeks ago, and when I came home, my daughter had roasted a chicken for dinner. So I definitely think it’s good that the kids are cooking and baking more – the food turns out marvellous and it’s cheap labour too!” she says, laughing. Aliza also says that aside from giving the children something to do while staying at home, cooking has also been a soothing balm for the fraying tempers and frazzled nerves caused by the pandemic. “It is stressful because the kids are cooped up at home, so of course sometimes tempers flare and every day, the younger two will fight. So all the cooking and baking is a form of therapy for them, ” she says. One of the few good things about the lockdown is that it has given many families the opportunity to spend more time together, which in turn has caused a ripple effect in terms of the number of parents who have used the time to teach their children the wonders of cooking. So once the threat of the pandemic is well and truly over, it is very likely that a whole new generation of children will have become highly skilled cooks – something that probably never would have happened with such alacrity without the alchemy of the pandemic thrown into the mixture. Indeed, many of the parents I spoke to admit that their children’s cooking skills now either match or surpass their own. “Hao Er is already very, very good at chopping, dicing and cutting up ingredients – he’s much better than me honestly, ” says Pang, laughing. And while there is much to admire in children who can whip up amazing meals, cooking during the lockdown has the added benefit of imparting many lifelong lessons to the younger generation, chief of which is the ability to form some degree of independence. “There is still a mentality among Asians that men shouldn’t be doing the cooking and that it’s a job for girls. I don’t want my son to learn this. That is why I make my son and my daughter cook together, so it is something that is rooted in both of them from a young age. “Also learning how to cook will be useful for them when they are older as they don’t have to rely on takeaway meals – they can save money and cook instead, ” says Abirah. Pang also believes that getting young children involved in cooking can give them a heightened appreciation for the food on the table. “My child can be a bit choosy about food but when he cooks meals himself, he will try to eat it because he knows the effort that goes into it. So he will promote the meal to everyone around the table and will say things like, ‘Daddy, this is very nice – try it!” says Pang, laughing. For younger children, cooking has opened their eyes to the origins of ingredients, something that remains a mystery to many small kids. “I think a lot of small children don’t understand how raw ingredients become meals. Just a few weeks ago, I asked my five-year-old son to clean a fish as part of his cooking lesson. “He was so disgusted because there was blood, but after that he found it fun looking at the gills and head and tail. I think he learnt something from it, because he realised that this is what he has been eating the whole time, ” says Odelia. Bhuma says that having to make something like yoghurt from scratch or even reading a recipe can offer many lessons to small children. “Even simple things like following the instructions in a recipe, you wouldn’t think too much about it, but it is important, because kids learn structural aspects that they can apply when they are writing compositions for instance, so there is a lot of overlap. “And then when they learn how to make something like yoghurt, they start to connect the dots that milk is from cows and so yoghurt is a dairy product, ” she says. Ultimately though, perhaps the most profound lesson that parents and children will take away from this experience of cooking during the lockdown is the immeasurable importance of family. “Now we have more time to really see our kids, especially while cooking together when they talk to us about what’s happening in their lives. “In my family, everyone now has a role to play in preparing family meals, including my eight-year-old who is in charge of setting the table. And when we are eating, we put all our gadgets away and bond, talking about everything from teenage woes to their crushes! And afterwards, everyone helps clean up together – otherwise they have to face my wrath, ” says Aliza, laughing. TERTIARY education is a means towards achieving one’s future goals and aspirations.

"Eating red meat regularly can lead to higher incidences of colorectal cancer, according to new research. — KINDEL MEDIA/Pexels An interesting research paper published on 17 June 2021 indicates there is a demonstrable link between consumption of red meat and incidences of colorectal cancer. This is not a new story, by the way, as the International Agency for Research on Cancer had already determined back in 2015 that processed meat was carcinogenic and red meat was probably carcinogenic to humans. However, the way the mechanistic connection between red meat and colorectal cancer was established recently was a compelling read. In short, the research determined there is “an alkylating mutational signature in (cancerous) colon cells” which is directly linked to “red meat consumption and cancer driver mutations”. The key word is “alkylating” or the action of “alkylation”. This is significant because alkylating agents were among the first anti-cancer drugs and are still the most used drugs in chemotherapy today. That is because alkylating agents act directly on DNA in cells, causing perturbations to the structure of DNA which is intended to stop cancerous cells from dividing and spreading. However, in some cases, alkylation just damages DNA and can cause cancers as a result. The paper ‘Discovery and features of an alkylating signature in colorectal cancer’ was the result of a collaboration of several international institutes led by the Medical Oncology department of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, USA. It was a longitudinal study over many years covering 238, 130 women and 51, 529 men who repeatedly provided data on their diets, lifestyles, and other factors. To understand what a longitudinal study means, refer to my previous article  Out of the total group of 289, 659 women and men, there were 4, 855 cases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) detected over the years of which 900 cases were examined in detail for genetic mutations. A common alkylating pattern was found in these cases affecting the genes known as KRAS p.G12D, KRAS p.G13D, and PIK3CA p.E5454K. How these mutations occur is curious and one cause seems to be related to damage caused to an enzyme called O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). MGMT is known as a DNA “suicide” repair enzyme, able to prevent gene mutation, cell death and formation of tumours due to alkylating agents. It appeared that certain compounds in red meat (and processed meats) methylates MGMT (by substitution of certain atoms in MGMT by a CH3 methyl group of molecules) which causes the deactivation of normal MGMT functions. Methylation is the most common type of alkylation, which is defined as the substitution of cell molecules by alkyl groups such as free radicals obtained from diets or the environment. The inactivation of MGMT alone may not explain fully the role of red meat in CRC. The alkylation damage due to red meat is relatively small compared to other natural mutational processes. However, such small alkylation effects may end up having a higher carcinogenic potential because of the sensitivity of the target genes, i.e., KRAS and PIK3CA. It is still unclear which compounds in red meat causes such alkylation effects. The most likely candidates are metabolites (by-products arising from digestion) called nitroso-compounds (NOC). Related NOCs such as nitrosamines are known to be significantly carcinogenic in test mammals and humans, and usually arise from eating processed meats treated with nitrites. In red meat, a potential culprit is heme, the pink/reddish blood-like fluid in muscle flesh, which can promote the formation of NOCs during digestion via a poorly understood process called nitrosylation (i.e. the reaction of nitric oxide with protein residues). Depending on the circumstances, nitrosylation can also affect enzyme activity, including MGMT. This in turn allows alkylation in cells to happen more frequently, with post-digested alkylated cells passing further through the digestive tract. The higher incidence of CRCs found near the rectum may be the result of more contact by colon tissue with alkylated cells stored as faeces in the distal colon (lower portion of the large intestine). It is suggested that although alkylation started earlier in the dietary tract, the movement of digested red meats through the intestine means that alkylated cells end up concentrated in the distal colon where they had the most impact on colorectal tissue due to constant contact. The signature pattern of alkylated tumour genes found in CRCs appeared to be limited to people with a high consumption of red meats. No such alkylating signatures were found for people who consumed poultry or fish or have other lifestyle factors (such as high BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption or lack of activity). Curiously, no other significant mutational processes were associated with red meat; CRC patients appeared to only have alkylated cell damage. Therefore, one would assume the level of alkylating cell damage would be an indicator for CRC, and indeed people with the highest levels of alkylating damage had a 47% greater risk of dying from CRC. As such, it was proposed that the identification of people who are genetically prone to acquiring alkylating damage may be helpful to prevent the onset of CRC via adjustments to their diets. To put things into context, the lifetime risk of developing CRC is around 4% in the USA and is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. However, the number of deaths from CRC amongst people under the age of 55 has increased by 1% per year from 2008 to 2017 (where the data stopped). The evidence suggests diets may have had an impact in such an unusual persistent pattern of incremental deaths from CRC amongst younger people. From the above, some readers may feel puzzled about the reams of advice offered on the media which claimed various benefits of eating red meat. The usual excuses are better availability of proteins, iron, and other minerals. That is true to some extent, but it is categorically not true that the “best” source is always red meat. There are many other sources of proteins and minerals, include seafood, poultry, and plant-based foods. There are also often many media stories about how there is “no harm” in certain foods, based on research which are often skewed by the heavy presence of younger people in the studies. However, I am of an age (along with many people) where sensible dietary practices can make a significant improvement to well-being and life expectancy. As an example, in the American Association of Retired Persons Diet and Health Study, an analysis of 416, 104 men and women found that substituting plant-based protein in place of animal protein for only 3% of calorie intake resulted in a 10% reduction in mortality. Curiously, substituting plant protein for egg protein reduced cardiovascular risks by over 20% and replacing meat proteins by plant proteins cut the same risks by over 13%. More on this later. The data is quite clear though, whatever the media say. Many similar studies had arrived at roughly the same positive findings regarding the consistent role of plant proteins in promoting general health and reduced mortality rates. Furthermore, a small 2020 international study conducted by Stamford Hospital in the USA on just under 3, 000 healthcare workers found that people following pescatarian-based and plant-based diets had respectively 59% and 73% lower risk of moderate-to-severe reactions to a Covid-19 infection. In contrast, people on low-carbohydrate, high protein diets (e.g. keto diet) were estimated to have a 48% higher probability of moderate-to-severe reactions to a Covid-19 infection. However, the data probably also indicated that a varied diet may be a significant factor. People who eat more plant-based and pescatarian-based diets often consume a wide variety of other foods such as fruits, nuts, and vegetables. And people on low-carb diets also tend to eat a lot of meat. How such diets affect human responses to Covid-19 has not been established but it may be due to less inflammation in diets containing less animal protein. There are some theories why eggs are possibly unhealthy. The current theory is that egg yolks contain phosphatidylcholine, which is converted by human intestinal bacteria to trimethylamine. Absorbed trimethylamine is oxidised by the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is known to cause atherosclerosis in studies of laboratory mammals. In a study of 4, 007 patients in a USA clinic, those with the highest levels of TMAO had a 250% increase in the three-year incidence of strokes, cardiovascular event, or death. Regarding meat, a plausible hypothesis centres around carnitine. Red meat has four times as much carnitine as white meat, and carnitine can be processed by gut bacteria into TMAO. Furthermore, the digestion of meat, in particular red meat, can result in gut intestinal-generated toxic metabolites such as p-cresylsulfate, hippuric acid, indoxyl sulfate, p-cresylglucuronide, phenylacetylglutamine, and phenylsulfate. They are produced from the decomposition of amino acids within meat proteins, so consumption of animal flesh raises their presence in blood plasma. These compounds then need to be filtered out by the kidneys. Hence, overall health is strongly correlated with a good renal system. Sadly, kidney function declines with age and by age 80, the kidneys have a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of around 60 mL/min or less, down from 90-120 mL/min for young adults. A decrease in GFR appears to be a function of aging, with GFR declining by 10 mL/min per decade of life. This means the ability to excrete such metabolites declines significantly as one ages, resulting in such toxic compounds circulating in the body for longer thereby increasing the potential for causing harm to various organs. Therefore, data suggests it would be a good idea to cut down on eggs and red meat to compensate for declining renal function as one gets older.

"KUNG pao chicken is a popular dish that is found in almost every Chinese restaurant all over the world. The recipe originated from Sichuan province in China and it has become a staple dish at Americanised Chinese restaurants. There may be slight variations in seasoning depending on the different regions, but the basic components are chicken cubes, cashew nuts and dried red chillies, all smothered in a sweet and spicy dark gravy. If you’ve ever had kung pao chicken in a Westernised Chinese restaurant, then you may have encountered bell pepper, carrots, and orange juice in the dish, a result of the recipe having evolved with time and distance. This favourite dish has other versions, with recipes that substitute chicken with pork, fish, shrimp or frog. The dish is believed to have been named after Ding Baozhen, the governor of Sichuan province during the late Qing Dynasty. He was one of the gongbao, or kung pao, which literally means “palace guardian”. The chicken meat used is often cut into small cubes, or gai ding, which is also a play on words for the surname Ding. The original kung pao chicken recipe calls for Sichuan peppercorns, although the dish doesn’t have the numbing mala flavour profile that these peppers usually present. The trace amount that is flash-fried at the beginning of this dish is just enough to add fragrance to the oil without extruding all its numbing qualities. It is common to find peanuts in kung pao chicken instead of cashew nuts — they are both interchangeable in this dish. Although some prefer toasting nuts in a dry wok, purists will say that the nuts should be fried in oil before other ingredients are added. Whichever method you choose, it is recommended that the nuts be removed from the wok before other ingredients are cooked, then returned to the dish just before serving, to retain their crunchiness. As in all Chinese dishes, properly prepared kung pao chicken has to balance the piquancy of the pepper with sugar, soy sauce and vinegar in the final gravy seasoning. 5 stalks spring onions, diced and separated into whites and greens Marinate chicken with marinade ingredients for 10 to 20 minutes. Mix gravy ingredients in a small bowl until cornstarch is dissolved. Add cashew nuts and toast until light golden. Remove cashews. Heat oil in wok over high heat. Add dried chillies and Sichuan peppercorns and temper until oil gets fragrant. Add ginger and garlic and saute 30 seconds until fragrant. Add chicken, cook until meat turns white, then add the scallion whites and red onion. Add gravy and bring to a simmer, until the sauce has reduced into a thick syrup. Just before dishing out, stir in red chillies, toasted cashew nuts and spring onion greens. TERTIARY education is a means towards achieving one’s future goals and aspirations.

"In a cloud kitchen, F&B entrepreneurs will have access to shared professional kitchen equipment and other services designed to help them deliver food to customers. Photos: Cookhouse IN a seemingly short span of time, food has become a highly digital commodity, buoyed by the incredible popularity of food delivery. In Malaysia alone, research firm Statistica estimates that food delivery will grow annually by 18% in the next few years. The success of food delivery portals like GrabFood and FoodPanda and the ensuing Covid-19 pandemic and global lockdowns have forced restaurant owners and new F&B players to think outside the box in terms of new business models that offer limited start-up costs and maximum profits, especially in these lean times. “I have noticed immediately that most F&B operators are moving towards ghost kitchens or cloud kitchens. People were already talking about it before the MCO (movement control order), but I think more restaurant owners are now thinking of collaborating and starting their own shared cooking space, ” affirms Joshua Liew, the spokesperson for the Malaysian F&B Operators Alliance, which has over 1,150 eateries in its member database. Cloud kitchens are essentially purpose-built spaces that function as shared cooking facilities. These kitchens typically don’t have store fronts or dine-in options, and are used solely to produce food for delivery. Most cloud kitchens offer integrated services that include everything from cooking space to refrigeration, bulk purchasing deals and opportunities to partner with food delivery portals. While research indicates that North America accounted for most of the global cloud kitchen share in 2018, the rest of the world is fast catching up. In South-East Asia, Grab has been a dominant force in the cloud kitchen market, opening more than 50 facilities in countries like Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. In Malaysia, cloud kitchens are relatively new (although cloud kitchen entities like Epic Food Hall have been around for a couple of years) but the concept is gaining traction, as many F&B operators have been forced to re-think how they want to operate, amidst the spectre of doom cast by Covid-19. Generally, there are three groups of F&B operators looking to launch their businesses in cloud kitchens – existing restaurant owners with brick-and-mortar eateries; home-based businesses; and aspiring/newbie F&B business owners. Huen Su San, the founder of Cookhouse, arguably the Klang Valley’s first co-sharing cloud kitchen, explains why F&B entrepreneurs are looking to climb onboard the cloud kitchen train. “For new start-ups, they want to start up in a cloud kitchen so that they can actually lower their risk and increase their profit margins (traditional restaurant margins can be as low as 3% to 5%) as well as get to profitability earlier by starting at a much lower cost. “So over here, with less than RM10,000, they can get an online food business going. If they were to do a traditional brick-and-mortar business, there are hefty costs associated with renovations, staff hires and buying their own equipment, ” she says. Start-up costs is at least RM50,000. Huen also points out that for food businesses operating from home, many quickly outgrow their capacity and are then stuck with the problem of not being able to take on bigger orders – something which a cloud kitchen can quickly solve. As for established F&B players, cloud kitchens help them by offering a cheaper, faster set-up if they want to penetrate a different market. For example, a restaurant in Sunway might want to open an outlet in Mont Kiara, but that would require rental, renovation costs, front-of-staff hires and a litany of other costs. But with a cloud kitchen, they can get the ball rolling faster and the model allows for higher profit margins too. At Cookhouse, Huen has designed a large, functional 10,000 square foot space with five private cooking studios, a shared co-cooking space that can facilitate baking as well as Asian and Western cooking and even a large event space. Rental rates for the shared cooking space start as low as RM900 per person, with all utilities included. The cooking studios meanwhile are priced at RM3,000 but members have to pay for electricity and gas usage, which is metred. The facility also offers refrigerators and chillers that can be rented ad hoc, packing facilities, a loading area and back-end infrastructure like cloud inventory system (by Food Market Hub), delivery partners and even social media and photography assistance. The cloud kitchen can also help businesses buy expensive cooking equipment and lease it back to them, if required. Most impressive of all, the facility is open 24-hours a day to paying members. “I wanted to come up with an ecosystem that could support new F&B entrepreneurs so it could shorten their learning curve and make them more profitable. That’s why over here at Cookhouse, we have other supporting partners and apps to help, ” she says. Huen was inspired to come up with a cloud kitchen after realising just how expensive it was to run a restaurant. “I run an event management space called Glasshouse by Seputeh and I also have eight Korean F&B outlets. While I was doing the two central kitchens about two to three years back, I realised that it was a super heavy capital investment that took a long payment period and the cash could have been used for expanding and growing outlets. “And it dawned on me that if people found value-added benefits when they share co-working spaces, what more if it was for kitchen equipment? So that’s where the idea came about, ” she says. Huen put Cookhouse together in just six months in an industrial area in Taman Medan (which aims to serve the Sunway, Subang and Old Klang Road market) and launched the cloud kitchen service in June, at a time when F&B operators were scrambling to find cost-efficient models to help generate revenue. “I think I’ve definitely benefited from the MCO. All of a sudden, it made F&B entrepreneurs actually question the traditional model or start looking for better models and more efficient models to sort out the problems they were facing, so it definitely was a blessing in disguise, ” she says. Since its inception, Cookhouse has quickly attracted over 10 F&B entities – a combination of home businesses like Halo Doughnut (which has doubled its sales since starting at the cloud kitchen), experienced chefs like former Hilton Kuala Lumpur chef de cuisine Darius Seitfudem who does five-star frozen ready-to-eat meal deliveries and established F&B eateries like Warung Wok. And this is just the tip of the iceberg as the space can accommodate up to 30 different businesses at the same time. Huen also has plans to launch more cloud kitchens in areas like central Petaling Jaya, central Kuala Lumpur and Mont Kiara. Although the F&B industry is struggling right now, Huen is convinced that cloud kitchens are both here to stay and the way forward for most businesses looking to minimise cost. Which is why she thinks these kitchens are very quickly going to be scattered everywhere in Malaysia. “I think in other countries, cloud kitchens have expanded massively way before the pandemic but the pandemic became the catalyst so it is accelerating things everywhere – even in Malaysia, ” she says.

"FILE PHOTO: Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya attends a meeting with Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (not pictured) at Bellevue Palace in Berlin, Germany, December 14, 2020. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on Tuesday that she had asked U.S. officials to impose sanctions on companies in her country's potash, oil, wood and steel sectors, as she visited Washington seeking stronger action against President Alexander Lukashenko's government. Tsikhanouskaya said she delivered a list of enterprises the opposition would like to see sanctioned, in addition to existing U.S. sanctions on Lukashenko's political allies and government bodies, during a meeting with State Department officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday. Her requests included the state-owned Belaruskali producer of potash fertilizer.  Such measures would go beyond existing sanctions by the European Union and the United States and “will be a real hit on him, to make him change his behavior and to release political prisoners,"" she said in a meeting with reporters in Washington. Tsikhanouskaya, 38, was a candidate in an election last August that Lukashenko's opponents say was rigged so that he could retain power.  Her husband, Sergei Tsikhanouskiy, is a video blogger who has been jailed since May 2020 on charges such as violating public order, which he denies. Tsikhanouskaya fled to neighboring Lithuania after Lukashenko's crackdown following the election. She called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop supporting Lukashenko. ""The relationship of Russia and Belarus at the moment is so close that the next step is loss of independence,"" she said. ""We understand that Lukashenko has to pay for the support of the Kremlin.""

"Children wash a sheep purchased for the upcoming Eid Al-Adha sacrifice as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases spike, in Dakar, Senegal July 19, 2021. Picture taken July 19, 2021. REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra DAKAR (Reuters) -     With COVID-19 cases surging across Senegal, Pape Gueye made the difficult decision to spend the first Eid al-Adha of his life apart from his 88-year-old mother.  ""I know a lot of people who had it,"" said Gueye, 43, mixing a cup of green tea as he sat with masked friends in front of his flat in the capital, Dakar.  ""Some of them got through it, and some of them died,"" he said on Monday, the day before the Muslim holiday to mark the feast of sacrifice, known in Senegal as Tabaski, when families gather together across the country. ""After what I felt and the people around me who had it, I will stay at home."" On the whole, the West African country has been spared the levels of death and infection seen in other parts of the world, recording just 52,671 cases and 1,227 deaths during the pandemic, according to health ministry figures. But cases have soared in the past week, threatening to overwhelm health services just as Senegalese prepare to gather in extended families for the year's most anticipated feast.   President Macky Sall threatened on Friday to close borders and impose a new state of emergency after the country broke its daily case record three times in a single week.  The day after Sall's declaration, that record doubled to over 1,350. Supply shortages mean the virus could have ample room to run. Just over 600,000 doses of vaccine have been administered to a population of around 16 million people. Not everyone in Dakar was on the same page as Gueye on Monday. Parking lots and street corners were lined with buses heading out of town, their roofs loaded with luggage and sacrificial sheep. Inside, few passengers wore masks. Some people scoffed at the idea that the risk of COVID-19 could trump a holy event. Others were more measured, yet steadfast in their desire to travel.  ""After staying so long without seeing your family members, your mother or your children, even if the COVID-19 situation is complicated, you close your eyes and go,"" said Alhassane Sow, carrying a machete he would use to slaughter the family lamb.

"Cooking together during Hari Raya always brings the family together and is a reminder of simpler times. From left: Zara Amanda Mohd Haikal, Maizatul, Tunku Maisara, Tunku Shariz and Tunku Muhammad Raziq. — Photos: ART CHEN/The Star In their cosy kitchen, Tunku Shariz Tunku Azmi and his wife Dr Maizatul Zolkapli are hard at work. The duo’s movements are graceful and dexterous – they never get in each other’s way, instead moving fluidly through the space to get things done. While Tunku Shariz stirs the contents of a kuali, his wife carefully spoons batter into a mould. In between, they exchange warm, knowing smiles. This scene is a replica of the one that will play out during Hari Raya, when husband and wife will cook all the family’s celebration dishes together with the help of their kitchen assistants – their children Tunku Maisara Tunku Shariz, 17, and Tunku Muhammad Raziq Tunku Shariz, 14. Because Maizatul is originally from Perak and Tunku Shariz hails from Negri Sembilan, the two bring together their favourite dishes – whether that’s a family recipe or a state staple – for Hari Raya. In the past, they often went back to Perak and Negri Sembilan for Hari Raya, but the couple isn’t sure if this will be possible this year. But even if inter-state travel is not allowed, they know they can pull off the Hari Raya food themselves, because they did it last year, even with some degree of trepidation. “Last year because of the movement control order, cooking the Raya meal was a real challenge for us. Even though we knew how to cook all the food and we’d watched our elders numerous times, that was actually the first time we did it on our own, so I think that’s why we’re a bit more confident this year. “Also if we don’t cook all these dishes, the kids will be asking, ‘Where’s the rendang?’ And we ourselves also want to taste the same things that we are used to, ” explains Tunku Shariz. So come Hari Raya, Tunku Shahriz and Maizatul will be rolling out the usual heirloom staples that have provided their family with so much joy over the years. Chief among these dishes is Maizatul’s family dish of rendang tok. The recipe is over 60 years old and her 71-year-old father inherited it from his uncle, who was the head cook in his village, tasked with cooking and taste-testing all the food prepared for weddings, kenduris and village feasts. Rendang tok is generally acknowledged to originate from Perak and was reputedly developed by palace cooks, who concocted it for the royal family and eventually shared it with family and friends once they left their jobs. The dish typically contains dried chilli paste and spices like cinnamon and cloves as well as copious amounts of coconut milk and kerisik. The key difference between a rendang tok and other forms of rendang is the cooking time, which depending on the volume of meat, can take anywhere from two to eight hours. This is because the rendang is cooked slowly until it attains pecah minyak (oil surfaces) and then cooked some more until the gravy reduces and the rendang is very, very dry and turns a very dark brown shade. “Last time, my dad would make about four or five kilos of beef rendang and would be cooking for hours, because in my family, he is the only one who cooks this rendang, although he taught it to me as well. “I usually just make 1.5 kilos of rendang and even that takes three hours to prepare and cook for Hari Raya, ” says Maizatul. Maizatul’s rendang tok is comfort food at its finest – tender, supple beef slices coated in a rich, dry, coconutey rendang paste that provides so much depth of flavour that one serving simply isn’t enough! The other dish that always has to have a place on the family’s Hari Raya table is Tunku Shahriz’ treasured family dessert of kuih bakar pandan tok nyah, an heirloom recipe from his late grandmother which Maizatul eventually learnt how to make because he loves it so much! Kuih bakar is a traditional Malay dessert that is sometimes also called kuih kemboja after the frangipani flower, because the old-fashioned moulds it was once baked in closely resembled the flower. To make the batter, a mixture of eggs, flour, coconut milk, pandan leaf juice, ghee and sugar are mixed together until a runny batter forms. This mixture is dipped into moulds (or cake tins) and baked in the oven. In Tunku Shariz’s family, the kuih bakar is made using 60-year-old cast iron floral moulds that have pride of place in their family’s kampung home. “The kuih bakar was a must-have in my grandmother’s house during Hari Raya. She always made a lot but there was never enough! When she passed away, we missed this delicacy so much that we wanted to revive the tradition of making it, ” says Tunku Shariz. According to Maizatul, the main difference in the family recipe is the addition of ghee in the batter, which makes the kuih taste much richer. “And the best thing about kuih bakar is the wonderful pandan smell that wafts through the house when it is baking. It smells so good and for me, that sort of sets the mood for Hari Raya, ” says Maizatul. The family’s kuih bakar is delightful – a slightly crispy crust gives way to a plump, soft, lightly eggy interior laced with pandan flavours. The ghee in the concoction gives it a rich mouthfeel that lingers on the palate afterwards. Although most of their Raya dishes are heritage meals, Tunku Shariz and Maizatul have also come up with something that is purely their own invention, a savoury lamb rice dish that they hope to teach their own children some day. The couple’s recipe is inspired by nasi Arab and makes use of lamb, sun-dried tomatoes and spices. In keeping with modern times, it is cooked in a pressure cooker to save time. “We thought it would be nice to have something besides ketupat or lemang on Hari Raya, because everyone gets sick of that. “So this is a very simple one-pot dish, because for Raya, we try not to spend too much time in the kitchen, so this way, we can leave the dish to cook in the pressure cooker and entertain guests, ” says Tunku Shariz. The rice dish is very, very flavourful – the lamb is incredibly tender and pliant and redolent of spices, while the rice has a slight sheen of oil without being overly rich. It is a very easy meal to enjoy, one where addiction is virtually guaranteed. In many ways, Tunku Shariz and Maizatul say they love cooking up all these Raya dishes together as the experience is a small reminder of the large-scale gatherings and cooking rituals they both grew up with in their kampungs. “This exercise usually brings the family together. We both work all the time, so cooking together for Hari Raya reminds us of the old days when we were young and life was simpler and everyone got together like this, ” says Tunku Shariz. In a blender, blend pandan leaves and water. Strain mixture to extract pandan juice. In a large bowl, add eggs and sugar and stir until sugar is semi-dissolved. Then add pandan juice and coconut milk and mix. Keep stirring slowly and gently until all the sugar is dissolved. Do not whisk as this will create air in the mixture. Strain the mixture into a clean bowl. Add flour and stir slowly until completely immersed. Strain again to separate any lumps. Move batter to a clean bowl, and stir ghee and salt into the mixture. Put the kemboja moulds (or cake pan) into the oven for 15 minutes. Once removed from the oven, grease the moulds with ghee to prevent the batter from sticking to the mould. Pour about 4 ladles of batter into each mould, enough to fill ¾ of mould. For cake tin, batter should come up to about ¾ of height of tin.

"FILE PHOTO: European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, July 14, 2021. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo BRUSSELS (Reuters) -     The European Commission listed on Tuesday serious concerns about the rule of law in Poland and Hungary in a report that could help determine whether they receive billions of euros in EU funds to help recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The EU executive had already raised many of the concerns in a report last year but they may now have real consequences as Brussels has made access to its recovery fund of grants and loans worth a total 800 billion euros conditional on observing the rule of law. The Commission said Poland and Hungary were undermining media pluralism and court independence. They are the only two countries in the 27-member bloc under formal EU investigation for undermining the rule of law. ""The Commission may take into account the Rule of Law report ... when identifying and assessing breaches of the principles of the rule of law that affect the financial interests of the Union,"" the Commission said in a statement. There was no immediate reaction from Warsaw and Budapest to the criticism in the Commission report. The EU executive has already delayed its approval on 7.2 billion euros for Hungary in an attempt to win rule-of-law concessions from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government and has not yet given the go-ahead for 23 billion euros in grants and 34 billion in cheap loans for Poland. The report said Hungary had not followed the Commission's request to strengthen judicial independence and that its anti-corruption strategy was too limited in scope. In a decade in power, Orban has partly used billions of euros of state and EU funds to build a loyal business elite which includes some family members and close friends. The Commission cited persistent shortcomings in Hungarian political party financing and risks of clientelism and nepotism in high-level public administration. Significant amounts of state advertising go to media supporting the government, while independent outlets and journalists face obstruction and intimidation, it said. The report also expressed concern over the influence of Poland's nationalist ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) over the justice system. It listed illegally made appointments and changes by PiS to the constitutional tribunal and other bodies, and Warsaw's rejection of EU court rulings binding for every member state. The Commission noted that the prosecutor general, responsible for tracking down state corruption, was at the same time Poland's justice minister and an active PiS politician. Since last year the professional environment for journalists in Poland has deteriorated because of ""intimidating judicial proceedings, growing failure to protect journalists and violent actions during protests, including from police forces"", it said.

Olivier Hoslet/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's Brexit minister David Frost will make a statement to parliament on the Northern Ireland Protocol on Wednesday, parliamentary authorities said on Tuesday. The protocol was agreed by Britain and the European Union as part of a 2020 Brexit deal, but has not been fully implemented yet and Britain says changes need to be made to make it work properly.  The statement will be made by Frost and repeated in the  House of Commons by Northern Ireland minister Brandon Lewis, according to a tweet from the Leader of the House of Commons on Twitter. Sources told Reuters on Monday that Britain would threaten this week to deviate from the Brexit deal unless the EU showed more flexibility over Northern Ireland. Deviating from the protocol would be a risky step: its aim was to prevent Brexit from disrupting the delicate peace brought to Northern Ireland by the U.S.-brokered 1998 agreement that ended three decades of sectarian conflict. Frost told lawmakers on Monday the protocol was not sustainable in its current form and that if an agreement could not be reached then London would consider all options, including unilateral action through Article 16 of the protocol.

"A resident wearing a rain cover stands on a flooded road in Zhengzhou, Henan province, China July 20, 2021. cnsphoto via REUTERS    BEIJING (Reuters): Heavy rain pounded the central Chinese province of Henan on Tuesday, bursting the banks of major rivers, flooding the streets of a dozen cities and trapping subway passengers waist-high in floodwaters. Henan, a populous province double the size of Austria, has been hit by storms since the weekend in an unusually active rainy season. No deaths or casualties have been reported, but the daily lives of the province's 94 million people have been upended by transport closures. In Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan on the banks of the Yellow River, more than 200 mm of rain fell in one hour on Tuesday, forcing the city to stop all subway train services. Dramatic video shared on social media showed commuters waist-deep in murky floodwaters on a subway train and an underground station turned into a large, churning pool. Henan is a major logistics hub but train services were suspended, while many highways were closed and flights delayed or cancelled. In Ruzhou, a city southwest of Zhengzhou, streets have been turned into torrents, sweeping away cars and other vehicles, footage on social media showed. A rising Yi River also threatened to hit the Longmen Grottoes, a UNESCO World Heritage site featuring millennium-old Buddhist statues etched into limestone cliffs near the city of Luoyang. Like the Longmen Grottoes, the Shaolin Temple in Dengfeng city, famous in the West for its martial arts, has been temporarily shut. Also in Dengfeng, an aluminium alloy plant exploded on Tuesday as water from a river surged into the factory. At least 31 large and medium-sized reservoirs in the province have exceeded their warning levels. From Saturday to Tuesday, 3,535 weather stations in Henan saw rainfall exceed 50 mm, of which 1,614 registered levels above 100 mm and 151 above 250 mm. The highest was in Lushan city, which saw 498 mm of rain, according to the provincial weather bureau. ""This is the heaviest rain since I was born, with so many familiar places flooded,"" said an internet user in the inundated city of Gongyi on Chinese social media.

Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS  DUBAI (Reuters) -     Iran imposed a one-week lockdown in the capital and a nearby province on Tuesday as daily COVID-19 caseloads hit a record high amid a fifth wave of the pandemic, state television reported. The lockdown affects Tehran and Alborz provinces, with only essential businesses allowed to stay open. Most offices, theatres and sports facilities must shut down in an effort to prevent the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, the TV said. Iran, the epicentre of the pandemic in the Middle East, reported 27,444 new cases on Tuesday, breaking the earlier record of 25,582 on April 14. Deaths rose by 250 to 87,624. The government has been accused on social media of mismanagement over the country's slow vaccination drive with only 2.3 million people fully vaccinated from a population of 83 million.

"Sixth generation kokeshi maker Kunitoshi Abe cleans up after making a kokeshi at his shop in Tsuchiyu Onsen Machi, Fukushima, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Joseph Campbell TSUCHIYU ONSEN MACHI, Japan (Reuters) -     When it was announced that Tokyo would host the 2020 Olympics, Kunitoshi Abe was thrilled. Coming from a small mountain town in Japan's Fukushima Prefecture known for its ""onsen"", or hot spring resorts, Abe hoped his community, which was badly affected during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that hit northeastern Japan, would benefit from the Games. Japanese authorities had touted the event as an opportunity for national revival after the disaster that left more than 20,000 people dead or missing and triggered nuclear meltdowns, dubbing it a ""Recovery Olympics"". But rising COVID-19 cases across Japan have forced authorities to hold the Games mostly without spectators, dealing a blow to the country's expectations. ""In the midst of this situation, I don't really feel it's any sort of 'Recovery Olympics',"" said Abe. ""The Olympics itself isn't really in the mood for the Olympics."" A sixth-generation kokeshi maker, Abe thought the Games might bring enough visitors to spark a renewed interest in the vial-shaped traditional wooden dolls he makes in his workshop.  Tsuchiyu Onsen Machi is home to some of the craft's last remaining masters, and giant statues of the dolls can be seen on town streets. Abe hopes the practice won't die out with him. The coronavirus outbreak has already been bad for his business.  ""I want people to come visit, but I don't want the coronavirus to come as well,"" he said. ""I am also doubtful about the safety of having sporting events with audiences."" Although most events will be held in Tokyo, Fukushima was chosen to host seven softball and baseball matches.  The first softball game will be played without spectators on Wednesday at Fukushima Azuma baseball stadium, ten minutes' drive from the town.  The town's onsens have seen visitor numbers depleted as well. Business is at half what it would have been in normal times, said Kazuya Ikeda, head of the local hot springs tourism association.  Ikeda believes the idea of a 'Recovery Olympics' should be reconsidered.  ""The coronavirus has spread throughout the world, and it is difficult for human efforts to overcome this all at once. This cannot be helped,"" he said.  ""It's a matter of time before this will be solved ... and in that sense, this 'Recovery Olympics' can still be fixed by human hands.""

"A member of the media has his temperature taken during an escorted and controlled tour for media representatives, ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, in Tokyo, Japan, July 19, 2021.  REUTERS/Molly Darlington TOKYO (Reuters) -     Foreign reporters covering the Tokyo Olympics were surprised to learn that what they thought was a chance to report outside their media ""bubble"" turned out instead to be a socially distanced sightseeing tour. Hoping to step out and report on the Tokyo beyond the Games, they were on Monday instead ferried by harried organisers from one empty tourist spot to another for two hours. Foreign reporters, largely confined by COVID-19 rules to their hotels and Olympic sites, have already chafed at measures such as GPS tracking and bans on interviewing ordinary people. Some Japanese media have in turn staked out visitors to see if they break quarantine. With the Olympics opening on Friday, organisers say the curbs are fair ways to fight Japan's spreading epidemic. Overseas media outlets have protested that they restrict press freedom, Kyodo agency reported. With repeated temperature checks, site visits limited to 30 minutes and social distancing, the reporters on Monday's trip took in sites including the Tokyo National Museum and the Hama-Rikyu Gardens, a bayside villa for feudal lords. ""We just went to the national museum with no photo-shoot permits, so that's no use for the media,"" said Finnish reporter Heikki Valkama.  Mikai Asai of the Japanese Tourism Board said the idea was to give cooped-up reporters some downtime to explore the capital safely.     ""Due to the many restrictions, (journalists) are not allowed to go outside to take photographs. But we’d like to share the Japanese culture, and for everyone to enjoy it as part of our hospitality,"" she said.

"Muslim pilgrims cast stones at a pillar symbolizing Satan during the annual Haj pilgrimage, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, in Mina, near the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Ahmed Yosri JAMARAT, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) -     Restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 during the Muslim haj in Saudi Arabia have also reduced the risk of the deadly crowd crushes that have marred the pilgrimage's symbolic stoning of the devil in past years, worshippers said on Tuesday. Before the pandemic, the annual haj rite typically drew more than two million Muslim faithful from around the world, with crowding regularly leading to dangerous incidents, most recently a 2015 stampede that killed hundreds. But only a limited number of mask-clad pilgrims hurled pebbles at a wall in a symbolic renunciation of the devil - historically the haj's riskiest ceremony - during Tuesday's Eid al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice).  For the second year running Saudi Arabia has banned worshippers from abroad and has allowed only 60,000 citizens and residents to participate in the haj. ""In the past it was overly crowded and people were jostling and scrambling at Jamarat and some were hurt,"" said Mohammed Salehi, a Syrian living in Saudi Arabia, referring to the site of the stoning ceremony.  Saudi Arabia stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina and the peaceful organisation of the haj, which has in the past been afflicted by fires and riots as well as stampedes. Multi-billion dollar government-funded upgrades to haj infrastructure since 2015, including erecting a three-storey bridge in Jamarat to ease congestion, have greatly reduced the frequency of such disasters. And, in a speech marking Eid al-Adha, King Salman lauded measures taken by the kingdom to ensure a safe haj ""in the shadow of this pandemic"" including deploying technology to allow physical distancing. With the coronavirus the main concern, authorities have restricted access to pilgrims aged 18 to 65, who have either been fully vaccinated or have recovered for the virus and do not suffer from chronic diseases.     This year, face-masked pilgrims clad in white robes signifying a state of purity walked in small groups, each at their own pace and socially distanced. ""They had pre-packed stones for us,"" said Pakistani pilgrim Urooj Qasmi. ""I'm not scared. Everything is very clean and well organised."" Worshippers will return to Jamarat over the next two days before continuing onto Mecca to pray at the Grand Mosque at the end of haj, a once-in-a-lifetime duty for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it.

"FILE PHOTO: Relatives cremate the bodies of persons who died due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at a crematorium ground in Giddenahalli village on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, May 2, 2021. REUTERS/Samuel Rajkumar (Reuters) -     India's excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic could be as high as 4.9 million, according to a new study that provides further evidence that millions more may have died from coronavirus than the official tally. The report by the Washington-based Center for Global Development, co-authored by India's former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, included deaths from all causes since the pandemic's start through June 2021.   India has officially reported more than 414,000 deaths due to COVID-19, the third highest tally in the world after the United States and Brazil, but the study adds to growing calls from experts for a rigorous nationwide fatality audit.  A devastating rise in infections in April and May, driven largely by the more infectious and dangerous Delta variant, overwhelmed India's healthcare system and killed at least 170,000 people in May alone, according to official data. ""What is tragically clear is that too many people, in the millions rather than hundreds of thousands, may have died,"" the report said, estimating the excess death toll during the pandemic at between 3.4 million and 4.9 million. The report did not ascribe all the excess deaths to the pandemic. ""We focus on all-cause mortality, and estimate excess mortality relative to a pre-pandemic baseline, adjusting for seasonality,"" it said.  India's health ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.              Some experts have said excess deaths are the best way to measure the real toll from COVID-19. The New York Times said the most conservative estimate of deaths in India was 600,000 and the worst case scenario several times that number. The government has dismissed those figures. Health experts have said the undercounting is largely because of scarce resources in India's vast hinterland where two-thirds of the population lives, and because many have died at home without being tested. India has reported a decline in daily infections from a peak in May, logging its lowest daily count in four months on Tuesday at 30,093 fresh cases.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has also been criticised for a messy vaccination campaign that many say contributed to the worsening of the second wave of infections. India has so far only vaccinated just over 8% of eligible adults with the mandatory two doses.  In July, the government administered fewer than 4 million doses per day on average, versus a record 9.2 million doses on June 21, when Modi flagged off a campaign to inoculate the country's 950 million adults for free.

"FILE PHOTO: Vials labelled ""Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine"" are seen in this illustration picture taken May 2, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic CHICAGO (Reuters) -     Scientists are working on a benchmark for COVID-19 vaccine efficacy that would allow drugmakers to conduct smaller, speedier human trials to get them to market and address a huge global vaccine shortage. Researchers are trying to determine just what level of COVID-19 antibodies a vaccine must produce to provide protection against the illness. Regulators already use such benchmarks - known as correlates of protection - to evaluate flu vaccines without requiring large, lengthy clinical trials. ""You could use it to predict efficacy from a vaccine, which will be more important as we are less able to conduct placebo-controlled trials,"" said Stanley Plotkin, inventor of the Rubella vaccine and an expert on correlates of protection. ""The information is flowing in,"" he said. ""By the end of this year, I think there will be enough data to convince everyone.""An established benchmark for COVID-19 would allow drugmakers to conduct vaccine trials in just a few thousand people, about one-tenth the size of the studies conducted to gain authorization for currently widely-used coronavirus shots, researchers and drugmakers told Reuters.     Those studies, involving tens of thousands of volunteers,  compared the rate of COVID-19 infections in people who received the shot with the rate in participants who got a placebo.     Such randomized, controlled trials may no longer be considered ethical in some countries, as researchers cannot give a dummy shot to people where an effective vaccine is widely available. In addition, many of the new shots are being developed by small companies that may not be able to conduct very large trials without government funding or a partner with deep pockets.     With an established correlate, drugmakers could test blood samples from a smaller number of trial participants who receive an experimental vaccine to see whether they produced that benchmark level of protective antibodies.  Such a benchmark is “urgently needed” to help overcome  challenges faced by vaccine developers and boost availability of shots, Dr. Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York wrote this month in the journal Nature.    Researchers at Oxford University late last month proposed a potential correlate of protection based on antibodies found in people who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine. The work awaits peer reviewed by other scientists.    Results from a U.S.-backed study of Moderna’s vaccine are expected to be published in a medical journal later this summer. ""We're writing the paper right now,"" said Dr. Peter Gilbert, a biostatistician from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.    Some vaccine experts question whether antibody levels will be a strong enough indicator of protection. Other components of the immune system, such as T-cells and B-cells, are thought to provide important defenses against COVID-19, but are more difficult to measure.  That has been the contention of some top vaccine experts at Pfizer, maker along with BioNTech of one of the most effective COVID-19 vaccines, produced in the largest quantities globally.    It is also possible that each different type of coronavirus  vaccine will require its own correlate, some experts said. Drugmakers working on a new type of vaccine likely would not be able to rely on the correlates based on Moderna’s messenger RNA shot, they say. BRIDGING THE GAP    Meanwhile, vaccine developers are trying to devise acceptable substitutes to huge, placebo-controlled trials. Some aim to show their shot provokes antibody responses at least as good as those seen with currently authorized shots.     European and UK health regulators are working with companies to set standards for these so-called “immunobridging” studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to say whether it would accept such trials for next-generation vaccines. “It doesn't have to be an established correlate of protection, but we have to ... arrive at the right pre-specified criteria, because we cannot risk that a second-generation vaccine ... is of low or modest vaccine efficacy,"" FDA vaccine official Dr. Marion Gruber told fellow regulators at a World Health Organization Meeting in May. ""That would undermine confidence in the vaccine enterprise."" Italy's ReiThera Srl is developing a vaccine using technology similar to AstraZeneca's and will try to demonstrate that its shot is at least as effective. The company has an agreement in principle on trial design with European and British regulators, ReiThera's senior director Stefano Colloca told Reuters. Massive clinical trials are ""no longer ethical and feasible in most countries worldwide,"" he said.    French biotech Valneva and Taiwan's Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp plan to test their vaccines against the AstraZeneca shot, even though both use a different technology. Valneva's trial design was approved by UK regulators. Medigen has a green light from Taiwan. Sanofi, with partner GlaxoSmithKline, and Canada’s Medicago are still opting for placebo-controlled trials involving thousands of participants, including in countries with high infection rates and fewer authorized vaccines available.  NEED FOR BOOSTERS?   The hunt for a correlate is underway from the UK to the United States and Australia. Scientists are comparing antibody levels in vaccinated people who became infected with COVID-19 to those who did not, to find a threshold of protection that made the difference.    Oxford University researchers said work is needed to address correlates for emerging virus variants, such as the highly transmissible Delta that has quickly become dominant globally.  Their proposed antibody model is based on trial volunteers who had mainly contracted the earlier Alpha variant, first identified in the UK.  U.S. government-backed scientists are studying infections in people who received the Moderna vaccine. Moderna spokesman Ray Jordan said the company is also working on the analysis and will publish updates when available.    The correlate benchmark might also indicate when and whether people need vaccine boosters. Pfizer has sought authorization for a third booster dose of its vaccine, citing evidence of waning neutralizing antibody levels. But the company has pushed back against the idea that those same antibodies could be used to predict vaccine efficacy. ""No formal timeline is in place to have correlates of protection established,"" a Pfizer spokesperson said. ""We will continue to work with the scientific community to better understand what immune responses, whether neutralizing antibodies or otherwise, might contribute to protection.”  (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago and Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt; Additional reporting by Emilio Parodi in Milan, Matthias Blamont in Paris, Michael Erman in Maplewood, New Jersey, Allison Martell in Toronto and Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Bill Berkrot) TRUE wireless stereo (TWS) noise-cancelling earbuds come in handy when you want to escape the intrusion of the outside world, block out the distracting sounds of daily life or devote yourself to work without interruption.

"A U.S special forces veteran Jason Lilley poses for a portrait at his home in Garden Grove, California, U.S.,  July 9, 2021. Lilley spoke to Reuters about his experience in Afghanistan and his thoughts as the U.S. leaves the country.  Picture taken July 9, 202.   REUTERS/Mike Blake GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (Reuters) -     Jason Lilley was a special operations forces Marine Raider who fought in multiple battles in Iraq and Afghanistan during America's longest war.  As Lilley, 41, reflects on President Joe Biden's decision to end America's military mission in Afghanistan on Aug. 31, he expresses love for his country, but disgust at its politicians and dismay at the blood and money squandered. Comrades were killed and maimed in wars he says were unwinnable, making him rethink his country and his life. ""A hundred percent we lost the war,"" Lilley said. ""The whole point was to get rid of the Taliban and we didn't do that. The Taliban will take over."" Biden says that the Afghan people must decide their own future and that America should not have to sacrifice another generation in an unwinnable war. Al Qaeda's 9/11 attacks on America triggered a nearly 20-year conflict that led to more than 3,500 U.S. and allied military deaths, the deaths of more than 47,000 Afghan civilians, the killing of at least 66,000 Afghan troops, and over 2.7 million Afghans fleeing the county, according to the nonpartisan Costs of War project at Brown University. ""Was it worth it? It's a big a** question,"" said Lilley, who  was on the front lines of America's Global War on Terror in Iraq and Afghanistan for almost 16 years.  He said he deployed believing troops were there to defeat the enemy, stimulate the economy and uplift Afghanistan as a whole. They failed, he said.  ""I don't think one life was worth it on both sides,"" Lilley said as he described his service and his perspective in an interview at his home in Garden Grove, southeast of Los Angeles. Lilley is not alone in reflecting on the U.S. withdrawal after nearly 20 years of war. Many Americans are. The perspectives of Lilley and other veterans can help inform the country about the costs of entering war and the lessons to be learned from Afghanistan. Lilley's opinions are his own and some veterans differ, just as Americans generally have different estimations about a war that improved women's rights and led in 2011 to U.S. Navy SEALS killing al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.  Biden's withdrawal has bipartisan support. A July 12-13 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed only about three in 10 Democrats and four in 10 Republicans believe the military should remain.  Lilley and other Marines who served in Afghanistan and who spoke to Reuters compared it with the conflict in Vietnam. They say both wars had no clear objective, multiple U.S. presidents in charge, and a fierce and non-uniformed enemy. Part of Lilley's support network is Jordan Laird, 34, a former Marine scout sniper who described completing combat tours in Iraq  and Afghanistan, which Laird and others called ""Vietstan.""   ""You have a deeper understanding of the plight of the Vietnam vets who came home with lost limbs and being completely and utterly tossed to one side,"" said Laird, who now campaigns to improve veteran care. He served in Sangin Valley in Helmand Province, one of the most fiercely contested parts of Afghanistan, from October 2010 to April 2011. In his first three months, he said, 25 members of Laird's unit were killed in action and more than 200 were wounded. His best friend bled to death in his arms. While in Afghanistan, Lilley said he grew to understand why historians have called it the ""graveyard of empires."" Britain invaded Afghanistan twice in the 19th century and suffered one of its worst military defeats there in 1842. The Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989, leaving after 15,000 of its troops were killed and tens of thousands were wounded.  Lilley says he was particularly disillusioned by the U.S. military rules of engagement in Afghanistan. He and other units were not allowed to make night raids on the Taliban, for example. ""Marines aren't designed to kiss babies and pass out flyers. We are there to eradicate. We can't do both. So we tried and failed,"" Lilley said. The U.S. Marine Corps referred Reuters to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the military command in charge of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, when asked about Lilley's comment. In an email, CENTCOM had no comment about Lilley's criticisms. A turning point in Lilley's thinking came when a Taliban prisoner told him the Taliban would wait out the United States and knew Americans would lose faith in the war, just as the Soviets did. ""That was 2009. Here we are in 2021, and he was right,"" Lilley said. ""Why did we lose guys? Why?""  Back from the battlefield, Lilley, physically fit and heavily tattooed, said he could not even look at the U.S. flag for several years because he felt so angry that his country had sent him and his colleagues to an unwinnable war. He says he has seen several mental health counselors, but his greatest support network is fellow veterans. Lilley is vice president of the veteran-operated Reel Warrior Foundation, which gives veterans a chance to break from the struggles of re-adapting to civilian life by taking them on fishing trips. He said he is disappointed that the United States does not seem to have learned lessons from Vietnam, where 58,000 American troops were killed in a war that failed to stop Communist North Vietnam taking over the entire Vietnamese peninsula. ""We should avoid war at all costs,"" Lilley said. ""Don't rush into the racket of war, into the machine of making money, contracts. A lot of people made a lot of money off of this.""  He said it took him years to let go of his anger.  ""I mean I knew what I was getting into, I mean I grew up on Rambo. I wanted to honor my family in the sense my grandfather fought in War World Two, I wanted to go down that same route and do the selfless thing, but it turns into reality quickly.""  Another of Lilley's Iraq and Afghanistan veteran buddies is Tristan Wimmer, also a Marine scout sniper. Wimmer's brother Kiernan, also a Marine veteran, died by suicide in 2015 after receiving a traumatic brain injury in Iraq before deploying to Afghanistan. Wimmer, 37, now runs ""22 Jumps,"" holding fundraising events where he does 22 parachute base jumps in a day to raise awareness about the scourge of veteran suicide. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) estimated in 2012 that 22 U.S. veterans die by suicide each day.  A VA spokesperson said via email that the department is dedicated to former veterans' physical and mental health. This starts with a program called VA Solid Start (VASS), which ensures all veterans returning to civilian life are aware of and have access to an array of help and benefits. Contact is made with them three times in their first year out of the military. Help under VASS is tailored to a veteran's individual needs and includes access to mental healthcare and resources to ease the stress during the transition to civilian life. Wimmer said of Afghanistan: ""By any metric you choose to measure it, it was a fruitless effort. Getting rid of al Qaeda or the Taliban - we didn't succeed. Increased peace and prosperity for the Afghan people? We didn't succeed.  ""In the process we sacrificed a lot of wealth, we sacrificed a lot of time, we sacrificed a lot of lives, not just American lives, but coalition lives and especially Afghan lives, to walk away essentially having accomplished not a lot. That's a really hard thing to stomach.""

"Debris lie on a street following heavy rainfalls, in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, Rhineland-Palatinate state, Germany, July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Christian Mang AHRWEILER, Germany (Reuters) -     Red Cross volunteers and emergency services in Germany deployed emergency stand-pipes and mobile vaccination vans to flood-devastated regions on Tuesday, attempting to avert a public health emergency.    Last week's freak floods killed more than 160 people, and wrecked basic services in the hilly villages of the Ahrweiler district, leaving thousands of residents knee-deep in debris and without sewage or drinking water. ""We have no water, we have no electricity, we have no gas. The toilet can't be flushed,"" said Ursula Schuch. ""Nothing is working. You can't shower...I am nearly 80 years old and I have never experienced anything like it."" Few have, in a prosperous corner of one of the world's richest countries, and that sense of disbelief was widely echoed among residents and aid workers coming to terms with the chaos caused by the floods. If the clean-up operation does not move swiftly ahead, more disease will come in the floods' wake, just as many had come to believe the coronavirus pandemic was nearly beaten, with rats coming in to feast on the discarded contents of freezers. Few recovery workers are able to take the kind of anti-infection precautions that are possible in more ordered circumstances, so mobile vaccination plans have come to the region. ""Everything has been destroyed by the water. But not the damn virus,"" said Olav Kullak, head of vaccine coordination in the region.  ""And since the people now have to work side by side and have no chance of obeying any corona rules, we at least have to try to give them the best protection via vaccination.""

"GEORGE TOWN: Eighteen people, including a teenage school dropout, have been arrested over an online loan scam that caused RM3mil in losses. Penang Commercial Crime Investigation Department chief Asst Comm Mohd Rosni Mohd Lazim said the group members, aged between 16 and 23, were arrested in two raids in Batu Ferringhi on July 15. “During the raid on a house in Jalan Sungai Emas Satu at 1am, we arrested 12 people, including two women. Preliminary investigations show that one of the suspects is a tenant of the house while the underaged boy is a dropout. “We seized 34 mobile phones, two laptops and 14 ATM cards,” he told reporters at the Penang police contingent headquarters here yesterday.ACP Mohd Rosni said following the first raid, one of the suspects led police to another house in Solok Sungai Emas, Batu Ferringhi, on the same day, which led to the further arrest of five men and a woman. “During the second raid, we seized 10 mobile phones, a laptop and 11 ATM cards,” he said. The syndicate’s modus operandi is to offer loans on social media. “Victims will be asked to give their personal information and the loan amount required. “The syndicate members will then contact the victims and ask them to make various payments as processing fees before the loan is approved. After the victims have made the payment, their calls will be blocked,” he said. At the same press conference, Penang Narcotics Crime Investigation Department chief Asst Comm Mustafa Kamal Gani Abdullah said a drug-trafficking syndicate doubling as a coconut delivery service had been detected with the arrest of four men and the seizure of 23.85kg of heroin worth RM265,000. “Police stopped a lorry at a roadblock along the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway at 10.05am on Sunday. A search inside the vehicle led to the discovery of 53 packets of heroin. The driver and two co-drivers, aged between 26 and 32, were detained,” he said. Following the trio’s arrest, police picked up a fourth man, a 35-year-old lorry driver, in Rungkup, Bagan Datuk, at 4pm the same day.

"PETALING JAYA: The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) is working with the authorities to investigate alleged wrongdoing during the immunisation programme. It said it would not hesitate to end the services of vaccination personnel for misconduct. “CITF views seriously the allegations concerning the Covid-19 jab administration at the vaccination centres that have gone viral. “As such, CITF is now working with the authorities, such as the Royal Malaysia Police and the Malaysian Armed Forces, which are conducting investigations into the matter so such incidents will not occur again,” it said in a statement yesterday. CITF said there were allegations surrounding a drive-through vaccination centre that was specially reserved for Malaysian Armed Forces personnel and their family members. It was alleged that the incident took place on July 17 at a drive-through vaccination centre in Kem Lapangan Terbang Sungai Petani, Kedah. Recently, there were viral claims that an empty syringe was used at the Casualty Receiving Station based at the camp there. “An investigation is being conducted by the Malaysian Armed Forces. “The individuals involved have been asked to come forward to give an explanation. “Disciplinary action has been taken on the vaccination personnel,” CITF said. The task force is also investigating two reports of empty syringe being used during vaccination. One case allegedly took place at the Malaysia International Trade and Exhibition Centre (Mitec) on July 17, which was reported by a member of the public. The other case allegedly took place at the Bangi Avenue Convention Centre on July 18, and a report was made by the healthcare officer there. “Any development about the issue will be announced by the authorities. “CITF will not hesitate to end the service of the personnel involved and will take stern action based on the provisions of the law. “As per the standard operating procedure, every vaccination volunteer must show a full syringe to vaccine recipients before inoculation. “The public is also urged to look at the syringe before and after the vaccination process to have confidence that the vaccination has taken place as it should,” it said. Meanwhile, Kuala Lumpur CID chief Senior Asst Comm Saiful Annuar Yusoff confirmed receiving a report from a man who claimed he was injected with an empty syringe at a vaccination centre. Software engineer Tan Wing Sam wrote on Facebook that he had gone to Mitec on Saturday. “When I walked into the booth, there were two staff members sitting down, and I went in with another patient,” he said. Tan, 28, said he saw a tray with one syringe and a vial but noticed that the plunger on the syringe was pushed right up to the end. “She rubbed my arm with an alcohol swab and just took the empty syringe and jabbed it to my arm. “About two seconds later, she pulled it out, put on a plaster and said it’s all done,” he said. He said when he asked her about the issue, she replied that it should have been done properly but if he wanted she would inject him again,” Tan said. “She then started the process all over again,” he added. Tan then raised the issue with a supervisor, who took him back to the booth and asked the person about the matter and she admitted what she did and apologised. “After I proceeded to the final station, the supervisor called me and assured that I received my vaccination during the second injection,” he said. Earlier this month, another man also claimed of being injected with an empty syringe at a vaccination centre. Selangor police had said an enquiry paper was opened in connection with that case.

"PETALING JAYA: Swimmer Welson Sim had to eat humble pie when he was beaten by Indonesian rival Aflah Fadlan Prawira in his pet event at the Tokyo Olympics. The 24-year-old could only finish sixth in Heat 2 of the men’s 400m freestyle competition after coming home in 3:58.25. Indonesia’s Aflah finished fourth in 3:55.08 with Alfonso Mestre of Venezuela the winner of Heat 2 in 3:47.14. Welson certainly struggled to get going from the start as he eventually finished way outside his seeding time of 3:49.55 and placed 33rd out of 36 swimmers in the field. Welson did the time when he took silver ahead of the Indonesian swimmer at the 2019 Philippines SEA Games. Welson holds the national record of 3:49.29 set in Australia back in 2019 and has been fighting to rediscover his form since he failed to retain his 400m freestyle SEA Games title in Philippines. The Sarawak-born swimmer also did not do himself any favour when he fell from his motorcycle and suffered a broken arm in March. “It has been difficult for Welson to get back his rhythm for this Olympics, especially after he had two pins inserted in his left arm after the incident. “He does feel the pain some days and we’ve got to give him credit for trying to prepare,” said Malaysia’s swimming coach Chris Martin. Germany’s Henning Muhlleitner was the fastest qualifier for the men’s 400m freestyle final taking place tonight with 3:43.67.

"PETALING JAYA: Swimmer Welson Sim had to eat humble pie when he was beaten by Indonesian rival Aflah Fadlan Prawira in his pet event at the Tokyo Olympics. The 24-year-old could only finish sixth in Heat 2 of the men’s 400m freestyle competition after coming home in 3:58.25. Indonesia’s Aflah finished fourth in 3:55.08 with Alfonso Mestre of Venezuela the winner of Heat 2 in 3:47.14. Welson certainly struggled to get going from the start as he eventually finished way outside his seeding time of 3:49.55 and placed 33rd out of 36 swimmers in the field. Welson did the time when he took silver ahead of the Indonesian swimmer at the 2019 Philippines SEA Games. Welson holds the national record of 3:49.29 set in Australia back in 2019 and has been fighting to rediscover his form since he failed to retain his 400m freestyle SEA Games title in Philippines. The Sarawak-born swimmer also did not do himself any favour when he fell from his motorcycle and suffered a broken arm in March. “It has been difficult for Welson to get back his rhythm for this Olympics, especially after he had two pins inserted in his left arm after the incident. “He does feel the pain some days and we’ve got to give him credit for trying to prepare,” said Malaysia’s swimming coach Chris Martin. Germany’s Henning Muhlleitner was the fastest qualifier for the men’s 400m freestyle final taking place tonight with 3:43.67. Welson will return to swim the men’s 200m freestyle tonight while Phee Jinq En will have her chance to make an impact in the women’s 100m breaststroke event.

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Gymnastics - Artistic - Women's Vault - Qualification - Ariake Gymnastics Centre, Tokyo, Japan - July 25, 2021. Oksana Chusovitina of Uzbekistan waves after performing on the vault. REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson TOKYO (Reuters) -     Five years before Simone Biles was born, Oksana Chusovitina was already an Olympic gold medallist in a sport whose brightest stars often fade early, their bodies battered by years of gruelling training. At 46, the Uzbek gymnast has defied all odds to compete at her eighth Olympic Games in Tokyo but following the opening day of the women's competition, she bid a tearful farewell after failing to make the cut for the vault final. With ticket-paying fans barred from the arena due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chusovitina missed out being given a rousing farewell from thousands of cheering fans but she was nevertheless moved by the standing ovation she received on Sunday from the coaches and fellow gymnasts who hailed her extraordinary career. ""These were tears of joy because so many people were supporting me,"" said Chusovitina, adding that she would have loved to have ended her career in the presence of spectators.  Despite the disappointment on missing out on the vault final -- the only apparatus she has been competing on in recent years -- Chusovitina said her life-long accomplishments outweighed her result in Tokyo. ""I had been preparing for things to end here, but it's impossible to be fully ready for ending your career,"" she said.  Chusovitina become the Soviet all-around champion at 13 and the world champion on floor in 1991. She won gold in the team event at the 1992 Barcelona Games and silver in the vault in Beijing 16 years later when she had temporarily switched her allegiance to Germany.  Chusovitina's career also embodies the political upheaval that rocked the Soviet Union. After competing under the Soviet flag, she went on to represent the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Unified Team, and her native Uzbekistan after the Soviet collapse. She later competed for Germany, where she moved to seek treatment for her son's leukaemia, before returning to compete for Uzbekistan. Chusovitina said her longevity had been fuelled by an intense passion for gymnastics. At the 2012 London Olympics she had announced her retirement, only to change her mind just 24 hours later.  ""There is no secret,"" said the Uzbek, who had made it into the vault final at the Rio Olympics five years ago. ""I just love gymnastics and no one ever forced me to do it. I do it with pleasure."" Chusovitina's grit and ability to adapt to changing times has awed the gymnastics community and she has often proved that age is no barrier to succeed in the sport. ""No words to describe how impressive that is,"" Aly Raisman, a six-time Olympic medallist, wrote on Twitter ahead of Chusovitina's performance. ""Forever an icon."" Now done with gymnastics, Chusovitina said she was looking forward to devoting more time to her family and opening a sports club in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan.  But for now, she just plans to relax in the sauna and wear a nice dress on Sunday night to celebrate her incredible career. ""My time in gymnastics dragged on, now there isn't much time left,"" she said with a chuckle.  Cloud Computing helps you do more with less.

"Expect national woman artistic gymnast Farah Ann Abdul Hadi, who will be dressed in her new attire with the Malaysian Tiger logo emblazoned on it, to get off to a roaring start when she gets into action in the individual all-around qualification today. “Yes, I designed this leotard with the motif of the Malaysian Tigers, which is also our team colours,” said Farah. Dressed for success, Farah admitted that she had mixed feelings on the eve of her event. “There is nervousness but I’m excited as well to compete in my first Games. I’ve waited for this moment for a long time now, and it is happening,” she said. After performing poorly in the balance beam at the 2019 SEA Games in the Philippines, Farah has brought a new element into the event and aims to ace it in Tokyo. “I’ve changed my balance beam routine a little. During the quarantine-based training at the National Sports Council (NSC) gymnasium, I tried out new skills, which were planned and devised by my coaches (Ng Shu Wai and Natalia Sinkova) and I. “I did it for almost 15 days, and it worked. I was able to perform it consistently, and I hope to pull off a clean routine in Tokyo. “As for the other events, especially floor exercise, I will stick to what I have done since the 2019 World Championships. I do not want to complicate the routine. I just want to get the executions right. “The judging is tough, but as long as you believe in your routine and do them without any errors, then you’ll be fine.” ​​​​​​​MANY local businesses are struggling to make ends meet and their agility to adjust under the new normal is continuously tested.

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Gymnastics - Artistic - Women's Beam - Qualification - Ariake Gymnastics Centre, Tokyo, Japan - July 25, 2021. Elisabeth Seitz of Germany in action on the balance beam REUTERS/Mike Blake TOKYO (Reuters) -The German women's gymnastics team opted to wear full-body suits in qualifications at the Tokyo Olympics on Sunday in a move they said was designed to promote freedom of choice and encourage women to wear what makes them feel comfortable.  The team, composed of Sarah Voss, Pauline Schaefer-Betz, Elisabeth Seitz and Kim Bui, competed in red and white unitards, which are combined leotards and leggings extending to the ankles. They wore similar outfits during training on Thursday and said they could chose to wear them again in competition. Voss said the team had discussed their choice of attire before competing on Sunday and had settled on the unitard. ""As you are growing up as a woman, it is quite difficult to get used to your new body in a way,"" the 21-year-old said.  ""We want to make sure everyone feels comfortable and we show everyone that they can wear whatever they want and look amazing, feel amazing, whether it is in a long leotard or a short one."" Voss said the team -- which wore full-body suits at the European championships in April in a move aimed at countering the sexualisation of the sport -- were keen for the trend to catch on. ""We want to be a role model in any case, to make everybody have the courage to follow us,"" Voss said.  The Germans' decision to wear unitards earned them praise from fellow competitors in Tokyo. ""I think it's really cool that they have the guts to stand on such a huge arena and show girls from all over the world that you can wear whatever you want,"" said Norwegian gymnast Julie Erichsen. ""I applaud them for that."" In recent years the sport has been rocked by widespread cases of sexual and physical abuse, prompting the introduction of new safety protocols meant to protect athletes. For women, the standard competition outfit is a leotard, with long, half-length sleeved and sleeveless garments allowed. Outfits covering legs are authorised in international competitions but to date they have been worn almost exclusively for religious reasons. ​​​​​​​MANY local businesses are struggling to make ends meet and their agility to adjust under the new normal is continuously tested.

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Handball - Women - Group A - Norway v South Korea - Yoyogi National Stadium - Tokyo, Japan - July 25, 2021. Marit Rosberg Jacobsen of Norway in action with Kang Eun-Hye of South Korea REUTERS/Susana Vera TOKYO (Reuters) -     Norway began their quest for a record-equalling third Olympic gold medal in women's handball with a 39-27 victory over Asian powerhouse South Korea on Sunday, while Brazil frustrated the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) in a 24-24 draw. Rio 2016 bronze medallists Norway dominated the opening half of their Group A clash - a rematch of the Barcelona 1992 final which the Koreans won for the second of their two gold medals - surging ahead 18-10 after hitting the post several times. The European champions raised their level after the break as the latest encounter between the two most decorated teams in the women's game threatened to turn into a thrashing, before South Korea staged a comeback only to fall short in the end. ""South Korea are such a strong team and so good at smaller passes... so we weren't expecting this result... this was above all our expectations,"" Norway left wing Camilla Herrem said. ""There were nerves at the start, but after some minutes our defence got better and we had the perfect goalkeeper."" Earlier, Brazil defended resolutely to throw Olympic champions ROC off their game at Tokyo's Yoyogi National Stadium and were unlucky not to snatch an upset win in the dying seconds as Bruna de Paula's throw from distance was blocked. Russian athletes are competing as representatives of the ROC - without their country's flag - due to doping sanctions. ""They're the current champions. Russia is always Russia. We have a lot of newcomers in our team for the Olympics, so it's an achievement,"" Brazil goalkeeper Barbara Arenhart, who saved nine shots, said. ""We showed to ourselves that we can fight equally with everyone. This is our heart. Our game is a lot in our defence."" Sweden handed world championship silver medallists Spain a crushing 31-24 defeat before Rio Games runners-up France endured a nervy finish to their match against Hungary, winning 30-29. A day after hosts Japan were hammered by champions Denmark in the men's event, their women's team made a disappointing start to their unlikely bid to win a first Games gold medal with a 32-21 defeat by the Netherlands. Dutchwoman Lois Abbingh fired in seven goals for the Rio 2016 semi-finalists, who took control in the opening half by going up 18-10 and never lost their grip on the match. Montenegro's Jovanka Radicevic sparkled with 12 goals in their 33-22 win over minnows Angola.

REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis TOKYO (Reuters) -     German world number one Isabell Werth and her two team mates topped each of their three groups at the Olympic equestrian dressage qualifiers on Sunday to make Tuesday's team final ahead of Britain and Denmark.     Team dressage medals will be awarded on Tuesday and individual dressage medals on Wednesday, with the three countries strong contenders in both. ""It's always very important that you have a strong field and that you have strong competitors because then you push each other to top performances,"" Werth said when asked about the rivalry between Germany and Britain. Britain's Charlotte Dujardin, the reigning Olympian individual dressage champion who celebrated some of her biggest wins on her now-retired horse Valegro, competed on her new horse Gio. ""I could not have asked any more of him tonight, he went in and tried his absolute heart out,"" Dujardin told reporters. ""When you have a ride like that, it doesn't matter if you win or lose, that's what it's all about for me going in there and you know when you had that ride where you know you've had everything and he did that for me tonight."" The Netherlands, which also qualified for the team finals, competed in bright orange tailcoats, making the most of a recent rule change to allow such colourful attire at major events.

REUTERS/Matthew Childs TOKYO (Reuters) -     Britain's Tom Pidcock has left nothing to chance for Monday's Olympic mountain bike race, training in a heated tent at home to prepare for Tokyo's soaring temperatures. The 21-year-old, a road rider with Ineos Grenadiers but returning to his cyclo-cross roots for a shot at gold, is one of the favourites along with reigning champion Nino Schurter and Dutchman Mathieu van der Poel. Temperatures are expected to be in the mid-30s again on Monday at the demanding 4.1km circuit but Pidcock thinks his unusual training regime in which he rides his training bike inside a tent will help him cope. ""It's the biggest factor,"" Pidcock, said of the heat and humidity that will test the 38-man field. ""I've been doing a lot of heat work, which I'm happy to tell everyone now, but before I didn't want to advertise it in case someone downplays the heat."" ""Basically, at the end of training I jump in heat chamber for 30-45 minutes and sit in a really hot box pedalling very slowly. My spare room has a tent in it. ""It keeps tripping the electricity actually, that's the only problem."" Pidcock, an Under-23 world champion in cross-country last year, has not competed on the road since the Spring Classics in a bid to prepare for the Olympics.

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Water Polo - Men - Group B - Serbia v Spain - Tatsumi Water Polo Centre, Tokyo, Japan - July 25, 2021. Branislav Mitrovic of Serbia in action. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel TOKYO (Reuters) -     Reigning Olympic champions Serbia got their title defence off to a rocky start when they were stunned 13-12 by a clinical Spain in their opening match of the men's water polo competition at Tatsumi Water Polo Centre on Sunday. Spain centre forward Alberto Munarriz Egana top scored with four goals for his team, who have resurfaced as a force to be reckoned with in the pool after finishing runners-up at the most recent World and European Championships. Spain shaded possession in a match marked by plenty of aggressive play on both sides, peppering Serbia keeper Branislav Mitrovic's goal with 25 shots before sealing a memorable win with desperate defending at the death. ""It wasn't an easy match,"" Spain captain Felipe Perrone Rocha said. ""Serbia are legends of our sport and it's never easy to beat the Olympic champions. ""We played amazing water polo. A result like this gives us a lot of confidence for the games to come."" Defeat does not spell disaster for Serbia, who are no strangers to making slow starts at major tournaments, having scraped through the early rounds in Rio five years ago only to blow away the competition in the latter stages. ""We didn't achieve what we expected,"" Serbia captain Filip Filipovic said. ""We really wanted to win this game but we need to be honest and admit that Spain were better tonight. ""At the start, I thought it was the most important game for us, but now it's finished we don't need to suffer so much."" Montenegro cruised to a comfortable 15-10 win over Australia to get their first points on the board, while Croatia easily overpowered Kazakhstan in the day's final match. Croatia, runners-up at the Rio Games, set an Olympic record for most goals scored in a men's match with a crushing 23-7 victory that bettered the previous mark by two goals. World champions Italy fired a warning to their rivals with a 21-2 dismantling of South Africa, whose return to the men's water polo competition for the first time since the 1960 Games in Rome began with a humiliating defeat. Centre back Francesco Di Fulvio led the charge with five goals, in a match in which every Italian outfield player managed to get on the scoresheet. ""It was really nice to start this competition against South Africa,"" Italy centre forward Michael Bodegas said.

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Water Polo - Men - Group B - Serbia v Spain - Tatsumi Water Polo Centre, Tokyo, Japan - July 25, 2021. Branislav Mitrovic of Serbia in action. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel Spain centre forward Alberto Munarriz Egana top scored with four goals for his team, who have resurfaced as a force to be reckoned with in the pool after finishing runners-up at the most recent World and European Championships. ""It wasn't an easy match,"" Spain captain Felipe Perrone Rocha said. ""Serbia are legends of our sport and it's never easy to beat the Olympic champions. ""We played amazing water polo. A result like this gives us a lot of confidence for the games to come."" Defeat does not spell disaster for Serbia, who are no strangers to making slow starts at major tournaments, having scraped through the early rounds in Rio five years ago only to blow away the competition in the latter stages. ""We didn't achieve what we expected,"" Serbia captain Filip Filipovic said. ""We really wanted to win this game but we need to be honest and admit that Spain were better tonight. ""At the start, I thought it was the most important game for us, but now it's finished we don't need to suffer so much."" Montenegro cruised to a comfortable 15-10 win over Australia to get their first points on the board, while Croatia easily overpowered Kazakhstan in the day's final match. Croatia, runners-up at the Rio Games, set an Olympic record for most goals scored in a men's match with a crushing 23-7 victory that bettered the previous mark by two goals. World champions Italy fired a warning to their rivals with a 21-2 dismantling of South Africa, whose return to the men's water polo competition for the first time since the 1960 Games in Rome began with a humiliating defeat. Centre back Francesco Di Fulvio led the charge with five goals, in a match in which every Italian outfield player managed to get on the scoresheet. ""It was really nice to start this competition against South Africa,"" Italy centre forward Michael Bodegas said. ""They aren't one of the favourites here, but we tried to approach the game with big respect for them.""

"Rugby Union - International Test - British and Irish Lions v Japan - Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland, Britain - June 26, 2021 British and Irish Lions' Alun Wyn Jones in action REUTERS/Russell Cheyne CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -     British & Irish Lions captain Alun Wyn Jones is warning of a South Africa backlash after the tourists went ahead at the weekend in the test series with a well-earned 22-17 win in Cape Town. In the first of three successive tests at the Cape Town stadium, the Lions fought back after being 12-3 down at halftime to the world champions Springboks on Saturday. ""Knowing the calibre of the player and the attitude our opposition have, we have to be better again, first and foremost within ourselves. But we also have to deal with what we know is going to come next weekend,"" Jones told reporters on Sunday. ""We know what we’ve achieved but we also know what we haven’t achieved. There is still plenty to do and this is a three-test series,"" said the 35-year-old Jones, who played the entire game despite dislocating his shoulder only a month ago. ""There were smiles after the game. In any sport, you have to enjoy moments like this as they don’t come round very often. But the focus will come pretty quickly on Sunday and Monday when we’re straight back into it,"" he added.  ""We are only a third done and that message has already been planted. It’s a time for everyone to take stock of where we are and be ready to move on to next weekend."" Jones said the Lions had not panicked after four penalties put the Boks nine points ahead at halftime. ""We were pretty composed at halftime. I wouldn’t say disappointed, probably more frustrated by the fact we put pressure on ourselves. ""Our kicking game got better in the second-half and the set piece became prevalent, so we can be pleased. But there are definitely things to work on from the early part of the game,” Jones added.

"Total focus: Chen Long of China in action during the match against Raul Must of Estonia. — Reuters PETALING JAYA: Lee Zii Jia and several other top players were fast and furious but all eyes were on defending champion Chen Long of China in the men’s singles opening group match competition. The 23-year-old Zii Jia hardly showed any signs of nerves in his first Olympic Games as he took just 25 minutes to brush aside Artem Pochtarov of Ukraine 21-5, 21-11 in the first Group M match at the Musashino Forest Sports Plaza. He will face Brice Leverdez of France next and the winner will progress to the last 16 knockout stage. The others – Japan’s Kento Momota, China’s Shi Yuqi, Indonesia’s Anthony Ginting, and Denmark’s Anders Antonsen were also clinical in their straight game opening match victories. The 32-year-old Chen Long, who has not played in any tournaments after his quarter-final defeat to Zii Jia at last year’s All-England, took his time to toy around Raul Must of Estonia before pulling off a 21-10, 21-9 win in 42 minutes in Group N. If Chen Long and Zii Jia win their last group matches, they will take on each other in the first round of the knockout stage to determine who gets into the quarter-finals. National coaching director Wong Choong Hann was happy with Zii Jia’s form but was wary of Chen Long. “Zii Jia had a good match to get his momentum going for the coming matches. He just needs to stay focused in every match,” said Choong Hann. “Chen Long however did not show much depth in his game. He allowed his opponents to push him deep into his game. “He still looks solid and ready. The only thing is that we don’t know how much he can go when the going gets tough. “All the top players had their nerves but played well. However, their lower-ranked opponents did not push them enough. It was not good enough to see for real how good they are.” Meanwhile, Chow Mei Kuan-Lee Meng Yean’s hopes to enter the knockout stage is over after they went down 21-17, 15-21, 8-21 to Japan’s Yuki Fukushima-Sayaka Hirota yesterday.

"PETALING JAYA: Nur Dhabitah Sabri pulled off a delightful surprise for Malaysia by finishing a strong fourth in the women's individual 3m springboard competition at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre. The 22-year-old was a picture of consistency throughout all five dives in the final to finish with 326.15 points in her pet event. Dhabitah was competing in her first Olympics final in the 3m springboard individual but kept her nerves in check with 63.00, 66.65, 61.50, 67.50 and 67.50.

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Tennis - Men's Singles - Gold medal match - Ariake Tennis Park - Tokyo, Japan - August 1, 2021. Alexander Zverev of Germany reacts after winning his gold medal match against Karen Khachanov of the Russian Olympic Committee REUTERS/Mike Segar TOKYO (Reuters) -World number five Alexander Zverev won the biggest title of his career when he crushed Russian Karen Khachanov 6-3 6-1 on Sunday to win the men's singles tennis gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics. The 24-year-old, who has yet to win a Grand Slam title, was in stunning form as he demolished Khachanov in 79 minutes to become the first German man to win a singles Olympic gold. Zverev, who secured a rare win over world number one Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals, became only the second German to win Olympic singles tennis gold by matching Steffi Graff's achievement at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. ""There are only few people in this world who are happier than me at the moment,"" Zverev said. ""I can't compare it because this is so much bigger than anything else in sports,"" he told reporters. ""A gold medal for me at the Olympics, the value is incredible. The Olympics is the biggest sporting event in the world. There is nothing compared to this. ""I have this golden thing around my neck and it is not one of the 50 gold chains that I normally wear.""  Zverev was flawless throughout and never allowed his opponent to get a look-in as he grabbed an early break and cruised to a 3-1 lead in the first set. There were no signs of any nerves as he broke Khachanov for a second time and bagged the first set when his opponent sent an easy volley wide on the German's second set point. Zverev had struggled with a string of personal issues in the past few years as well as a messy change of management while also building a reputation of being a hugely talented player who fails to close out big matches. But on Sunday not even the loud protests of a handful of anti-Olympic demonstrators, booming into Centre Court through a bullhorn, could distract him as he broke the hapless Russian again in the second game of the second set. Long criticised for his perceived mental weakness, including losing to Dominic Thiem in last year's U.S. Open final when he surrendered a two-set lead, Zverev proved the doubters wrong this time. He remained in complete control, thundering backhand winners past his opponent who could only look on as he settled for silver when he dumped a forehand into the net on Zverev's first match point. The German dropped to his knees before lifting his arms aloft in triumph, knowing he had finally landed a big prize. Khachanov has won all four of his ATP titles on hard courts but never came close to adding to that haul on Sunday.    Khachanov was competing in Tokyo as a representative of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) because the country was stripped of its flag and anthem for doping offences. Germany also won Olympic gold in the doubles with Boris Becker and Michael Stich at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta had secured the bronze on Saturday after beating Djokovic.

"Not short on inspiration: Lee Zii Jia has a chance to join the league of extraordinary shuttlers like (inset from top) Lee Chong Wei, Lin Dan and Taufik Hidayat who went on to win medals after unimpressive starts. PETALING JAYA: What do badminton legends – Lee Chong Wei, Lin Dan and Taufik Hidayat - have in common? All three of them fell short in their Olympics debuts before returning stronger for the next ones. There is a chance for Lee Zii Jia to join their league after crashing out early in his first Olympics in Tokyo on Thursday. Taufik went to Sydney 2000 as the top seed but was ousted in the quarter-finals. Four years later, he made amends in Athens by winning the gold. Lin Dan did the same prior to his back-to-back triumphs in Beijing 2008 and London 2012. He entered Athens 2004 as the overwhelming favourite, only to be shockingly sent packing by Singapore’s Ronald Susilo in the first round. When Chong Wei failed to impress in his maiden Games in Athens, little did he know that he would go on to win silvers in the next three editions. The 23-year-old Zii Jia can certainly take heart despite coming up short in his ambitious bid to land a medal in his first attempt in Tokyo. Seasoned campaigner Chong Wei has called on Zii Jia to keep his chin up following his 21-18, 19-21, 5-21 defeat in the last 16 at the hands of reigning champion Chen Long of China. “It’s okay for him to feel down, that’s normal because he’s an ambitious man who’s eager to achieve something great in his career at the Olympics,” said Chong Wei, who’s also the Malaysian contingent’s chef de mission. “This is not the result that he had hoped for, but he has to accept it and move on. The whole nation saw how he played. He has done his best and no one can fault him for his effort. “He can now afford a short break, but once he returns home and completes his quarantine, it’s time to get back to the grind. “The invaluable experience he gained from the first Olympics will help him to manage the next Games better. “After all, the Paris Olympics is just three years away. He should get cracking as soon as possible. “There’s still plenty of tournaments coming up and one of them being the World Championships (in Huelva in December). There’s still so much to look forward to.” Chong Wei has refused to draw comparisons between him and Zii Jia although the latter returned home empty-handed just like him. In his debut, Chong Wei, who was 22, battled gallantly before going down 11-15, 15-3, 12-15 to Chen Hong of China in the last 16. “The script was nearly identical. I was about the same age as Zii Jia and I also exited at the last-16 stage too after a hard-fought battle with Chen Hong,” said Chong Wei. “But I don’t think we can make any comparisons here. Zii Jia has got a lot more pressure than I do in the first Olympics. Not only that he’s the nation’s sole challenger, he also competed with the reputation as the All-England champion. “When I went to Athens, I was not targeted to win a medal. I also wasn’t ranked highly at that time, if I’m not mistaken I was the world No. 16. Ahead of me were seniors (Wong) Choong Hann and Roslin (Hashim), they were the ones expected to deliver.” On former rival Chen Long, Chong Wei said the two-time world champion’s classy performance did not surprise him. “Chen Long has prepared well. He’s also driven by possibly his last Olympics appearance,” he said. “The main reasons he prevailed over Zii Jia were because he was calm and collected. That’s what vast experience can do for a seasoned player like him.” WE recognise the importance of breakfast as the most important meal of the day, but are we doing it right to ensure we consume the right nutrients?

"PETALING JAYA: The tears shed by the usually cool Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik said it all after they won the country’s first medal at the Olympic Games. The hope of the nation was on their shoulders but the debutants did not disappoint as they fought brilliantly to upstage reigning world champions Mohammad Ahsan-Hendra Setiawan of Indonesia 17-21, 21-17, 21-14 in a 50-minute bronze-medal playoff match at the Musashino Forest Sports Plaza. It was only a bronze – but it never felt that special. It was the country’s long awaited first medal in the Games but more importantly, Aaron-Wooi Yik’s effort also saved badminton team the blushes from almost going home empty-handed for the first time since Athens 2004. But it was the manner Aaron-Wooi Yik pulled off the stunner that deserved a standing ovation. The underdogs were down after losing the opening game against the experienced Indonesians but showed dogged determination to make a remarkable comeback for only their second win against Ahsan-Hendra in eight meetings. They were four points down when Ahsan-Hendra cruised to an 11-7 lead in the second game interval and many thought that it was game over for the Malaysians. But Aaron-Wooi Yik proved they were made of sterner stuff when they fought back admirably to take the lead at 13-12 and hung on to seal the game. In the decider, the Malaysians took advantage of their error-prone rivals to open up a 4-1 lead and fought confidently all the way to make the biggest breakthrough in their young careers. So it was understandable when Aaron-Wooi Yik could not hold back their tears after ending their years of training and months of pressure and expectations with their first Olympics medal. “I’m just so, so happy. I felt so much pressure in the second game,” said a relieved Wooi Yik. “Although it wasn’t a gold-medal match, it was still the most important match of my life. Aaron and I have turned this into the best achievement of our careers. “This would not have been possible if I had not worked on overcoming my past confidence issue and weaknesses. “I hope this is just the beginning. I want to fight for more glory.” Aaron said it was his family who had given him strength to come back strongly in the second game. “When they were leading the second game by four points, I told myself we’ve got to sustain and handle the pressure. “At that time, the first thing that I was thinking of was my family. “They are the ones who give me the strength to carry on,” added Aaron, who dedicated the win yesterday to his wife Goh Mui Kee and daughters Albee Chong Rui and Alyssa Chia Shin.

"Soh Wooi Yik and Aaron Chia in action during the bronze-medal match in Tokyo. - REUTERS TOKYO: As national men’s doubles pair Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik celebrated their bronze-medal victory at the Tokyo Olympics on Saturday (July 31), one would have to forgive Wooi Yik if his thoughts strayed to one special individual. That individual, according to Wooi Yik, is none other than former national men’s doubles ace Soo Beng Kiang, who also happens to be his uncle. Wooi Yik said his uncle would always motivate and encourage him as well as share tips with him whenever he competes in any tournament, especially in major championships. ""He (Beng Kiang) always motivates me. He also sends me messages and shares tips with me. In fact, before I came to Tokyo, he also gave me words of encouragement. So, I definitely have to thank him for this success,” said the Kuala Lumpur-born Wooi Yik. In the men’s doubles bronze-medal match at the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza on Saturday (July 31), Aaron-Wooi Yik had to fight back from a game down to beat Indonesians Mohammad Ahsan-Hendra Setiawan. Their 17-21, 21-17, 21-14 victory for bronze is Malaysia’s first medal at the Tokyo Olympics after more than a week since the Games officially opened on July 23. Wooi Yik said the Olympic bronze medal had a sentimental value to his family as his uncle never tasted Olympic success during his time representing the country. ""What he could not achieve (as a player), I have achieved for our family. I am so proud of this achievement,” said the 23-year-old, whose father is also former national shuttler Soh Goon Chup. During his playing days, Beng Kiang forged formidable partnerships with other shuttlers, including Cheah Soon Kit (1990-1994) and Tan Kim Her (1995-1996). Throughout his playing career, Beng Kiang achieved numerous successes, including partnering Soon Kit to help Malaysia lift the Thomas Cup in 1992. But when it came to the world’s biggest multi-sports Games - the Olympics - Beng Kiang always came up short and his best achievement was at the 1996 Atlanta edition when he combined with Kim Her to finish fourth after losing in the bronze-medal match. Meanwhile, Wooi Yik said that he was really proud to have contributed the country’s first medal at the Tokyo Olympics, although it wasn’t the much-coveted gold. ""Our performance here (in Tokyo) is maturing. We managed to overcome the pressures of facing crucial situations and the experience will stand us in good stead in future tournaments,” he said. Aaron, meanwhile, believes that their bronze-medal feat at the Olympics had boosted their confidence to aim for more titles. ""We are very happy to have contributed one medal to the country and for ourselves as we move forward in our career. We will be more confident when competing in future tournaments,” he said. Aaron, however, does not want to put extra pressure on themselves should they qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics, saying they would continue to work hard and try their best to go for gold.- Bernama Cloud Computing helps you do more with less.

"Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik in action during the bronze-medal playoff at the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza, Tokyo. - REUTERS. MELAKA: Malaysian badminton star Aaron Chia's path to the Olympics actually began at the age of four when he often followed his father Chia Boon Foo to the badminton court, thus sparking interest in the sport so much so he started representing Melaka when he was just 11 years old. In fact, on the badminton court, the second of three siblings, who is now 24, learned the meaning of perseverance in facing every tournament and opponent without fear and never giving up. Boon Foo, 62, explained that this included the first time that his son was disappointed because he failed to be selected to enter the Bukit Jalil Sports School (BJSS) but he advised him to not to give up and continue to strive to show his best. ""Finally at the age of 14 he managed to enter BJSS and during Form 5, Aaron started training with the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM). ""For the past four years, Aaron has been very focused and busy with training and has a very busy schedule. His perseverance and sacrifices have paid off and we hope they (Aaron and his doubles partner) continue to achieve success in upcoming tournaments,"" he said in an interview with the media via the Zoom application hosted by Kota Melaka Member of Parliament Khoo Poay Tiong yesterday. Recalling watching the match ""live"" on television with his wife, Chan Mee Kee, 62 and several other family members, Boon Foo admitted that he could not hold back tears and shouted with joy at the success carved by them to deliver Malaysia's first medal, a bronze, at the Tokyo Olympics. ""We were very anxious as the match was tense and realised it wouldn’t be easy but we really believed in their ability. ""More special, it is their first appearance in the prestigious games and this success is very meaningful because it not only brings glory to the country but also unites Malaysians who gave unwavering support,"" he said. To be even more proud of, yesterday's victory also saw Aaron and teammate Soh Wooi Yik, 23, succeed in redeeming their defeat to world number two pair Mohammad Ahsan-Hendra Setiawan in the group stage competition.

"Arigato!: Malaysian Jeremy Gan (centre) guided Yuta Watanabe (left) and Arisa Higashino to a historic medal. PETALING JAYA: Former international Jeremy Gan added another feather to his cap in his illustrious coaching career. Yesterday, his charges Yuta Watanabe-Arisa Higashino defeated Hong Kong’s Tang Chun Man-Tse Ying Suet 21-17, 23-21 in the bronze medal playoff to become the first ever Japanese mixed doubles medallists at the Olympics. Watanabe-Higashino were the second pair guided by Jeremy to the Olympics podium. In Rio 2016, the 42-year-old also led Goh V Shem-Tan Wee Kiong to a silver-medal feat, 18 months before he left to seek a new challenge with Japan. Although it wasn’t gold, Jeremy was still proud of Watanabe-Higashino, whom he had started coaching in January 2018. “I’m so happy that Yuta and Arisa made it. They played absolutely well and deserved it,” said Jeremy. “As their coach, of course, I feel fulfilled too. It took years of collective efforts from the players and the coaching team for this to happen.” During his previous 15 years coaching tenure with the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM), Jeremy was also credited for playing a big part in the rise and success of mixed doubles shuttlers Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying. Asked if it was a different satisfaction compared to five years ago, he replied: “I think it’s the same. As a professional coach, I treat every team or players as equally important. “It’s my responsibility to help my players to develop and become better.” Watanabe-Higashino were already an established combination when Jeremy took over but he turned them into title-winning shuttlers. Under Jeremy’s tutelage, the duo won five titles out of seven finals, which is highlighted by two All-England victories in 2018 and 2021. They also became the first Japanese pair to win a medal in the mixed doubles at the World Championships after clinching bronze in Basel two years ago. The Olympics mixed doubles gold was won by China’s second seeds Wang Yilyu-Huang Dongping who upset teammates and top seeds Zheng Siwei-Huang Yaqiong 21-17, 17-21, 21-19 in a thrilling 69-minute final. It was sweet revenge for Yilyu-Dongping as they were previously beaten by Siwei-Yaqiong to the 2018 World Championships title in Nanjing. Watanabe-Higashino’s bronze was the home side’s only medal in the Olympic Games as Japan suffered a big collapse in all the other events. Yesterday, the challenge of 2017 world champion Nozomi Okuhara and Akane Yamaguchi also ended in the women’s singles quarter-finals. Okuhara, who won a bronze at the Rio Olympics, went down 21-13, 13-21, 14-21 to China’s He Bingjiao while Yamaguchi went down fighting 13-21, 20-22 to P.V Sindhu of India. ​​​​​​​MANY local businesses are struggling to make ends meet and their agility to adjust under the new normal is continuously tested.

Krystsina Tsimanouskaya of Belarus reacts after competing in Heat 6 REUTERS/Aleksandra Szmigiel TOKYO (Reuters) -     A Belarusian sprinter said she was taken to the airport against her wishes on Sunday to board a flight back home after she publicly complained about national coaches at the Tokyo Olympics. Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, who was due to compete in the women's 200 metres on Monday, told Reuters she did not plan to return to her country and that she had sought the protection of Japanese police at Tokyo's Haneda airport so she would not have to board the flight. ""I will not return to Belarus,"" she told Reuters in a message over Telegram. The Belarusian Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tsimanouskaya, 24, said coaching staff had come to her room on Sunday and told her to pack. She was taken to the airport before she could run in the 200 metres and 4x400 metres relay on Thursday. She said she had been removed from the team due ""to the fact that I spoke on my Instagram about the negligence of our coaches"". Tsimanouskaya had previously complained she was entered in the 4x400 m relay after some members of the team were found to be ineligible to compete at the Olympics because they had not undergone a sufficient amount of doping tests. ""Some of our girls did not fly here to compete in the 4x400 m relay because they didn't have enough doping tests,"" Tsimanouskaya told Reuters from the airport.  ""And the coach added me to the relay without my knowledge. I spoke about this publicly. The head coach came over to me and said there had been an order from above to remove me.""   Tsimanouskaya added she was standing next to Japanese police at the airport and she has reached out to a member of the Belarusian diaspora in Japan to retrieve her at the airport. Haneda police said there was no one immediately available to comment.

Eugene Hoshiko/Pool via REUTERS TOKYO (Reuters) -     The International Olympic Committee does not plan to call for a moment of silence at the Tokyo Games on Aug. 6, the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, instead aiming to honour it in the Tokyo 2020 closing ceremony, organisers said on Sunday. Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui sent a letter dated July 28 to IOC President Thomas Bach asking for a moment of silence to be observed. ""I am hoping that athletes and Games-related people will touch upon the reality of the atomic bombing in some way,"" Matsui said in the letter, made public on the city's web site. ""I wonder if you could call on them to observe a moment of silence at 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6 at the athletes' village or wherever each of them is and participate in the Peace Memorial Ceremony to be held in Hiroshima on that day in their minds."" The U.S. atomic bombing occurred at 8:15 a.m. on Aug 6, 1945, which reduced the city to ashes and killed some 140,000 people by the end of the year. Bach visited Hiroshima on July 16, a week before the Tokyo Olympics' opening ceremony, laid a wreath at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park cenotaph and called the Games a ""beacon of hope"" for a peaceful future. ""According to the IOC, since the Rio (de Janeiro) Games, a programme to give our thoughts to those who lost their lives in grievous events in history and for other various reasons has been incorporated in the closing ceremony,"" Tokyo 2020 spokesperson Masa Takaya said in an email message.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria ENOSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) -     Denmark's Anne-Marie Rindom was crowned champion in the women's Laser Radial sailing class on Sunday, after her team helped her bounce back from a horrible misunderstanding on Friday that almost saw her give up a golden opportunity for Olympic victory.

"FILE PHOTO: Rugby Union - First Test - South Africa v British and Irish Lions - Cape Town Stadium, Cape Town, South Africa - July 24, 2021 British and Irish Lions' Stuart Hogg in action REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/File Photo CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -     British & Irish Lions fullback Stuart Hogg has denied he bit rival Willie le Roux on the arm during Saturday’s tempestuous 27-9 defeat to South Africa after accusations surfaced on social media following the match. A scuffle involving most of the players on the pitch took place in an ill-tempered first half, with Hogg and Le Roux squaring up. The Scotsman can be seen with his face buried in Le Roux’s arm, but he has denied any wrongdoing.  ""Following speculation that has surfaced online, I would like to categorically deny any foul play in last night’s game,"" Hogg said in a statement released by the Lions on Sunday.  ""I would never bite an opponent and I am annoyed and upset by this unsubstantiated accusation. I’ve always been proud of playing rugby in the spirit of the game.  ""Respect to the Springboks for their deserved win yesterday. The squad is hurting after last night’s defeat, but it’s all to play for next week. It’s going to be a cup final and everyone’s going to be up for it."" Le Roux and the South Africa side have not commented on the accusations. There were a number of flashpoints and incidents of foul play during the match, with both teams reduced to 14 players after yellow cards for the Lions’ South African-born wing Duhan van der Merwe and Bok flyer Cheslin Kolbe. Kolbe was fortunate not to get a red card when he connected with airborne Lions scrumhalf Conor Murray, an incident that could yet get the attention of the citing commissioner. The series is locked at 1-1 heading into the third and final match at the Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. ​​​​​​​MANY local businesses are struggling to make ends meet and their agility to adjust under the new normal is continuously tested.

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Boxing - Men's Featherweight - Quarterfinal - KKG - Kokugikan Arena - Tokyo, Japan - August 1, 2021. Samuel Takyi of Ghana in action against Ceiber Avila of Colombia REUTERS/Yara Nardi TOKYO (Reuters) -     A dramatic day of action before the gold medal bouts start taking place featured a disqualification that led to a furious Frenchman refusing to budge from the ring, while Samuel Takyi secured Ghana's first Olympic boxing medal in almost 50 years.  In the last match of the early session at Tokyo's Kokugikan arena on Sunday, French super heavyweight Mourad Aliev was disqualified for what the referee deemed an intentional headbutt - a call he protested with an hour-long ring-side sit-in https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/boxing-frances-aliev-disqualified-protests-with-sit-in-ringside-2021-08-01. That was only after the Moscow-born Frenchman expressed his contempt for the decision by spitting out his mouth guard and kicking it away, flashing offensive gestures twice and shaking and punching at a TV camera. ""It's totally unfair - I was winning the match,"" Aliev told a throng of reporters after finally abandoning his ring-side spot. The first round had gone to Aliev 3-2.  His opponent, Britain's Frazer Clarke, suffered cuts on his face and won the bout with four seconds left in the second round. The day turned out far better for Ghanaian featherweight Samuel Takyi, who overpowered his Colombian opponent Ceiber Avila to win at least a bronze - the country's first boxing medal in nearly 50 years. It was also the country's first medal at the Olympics since Ghana won bronze in soccer in 1992.    ""I'm going to make history and I'm going to win the gold colour,"" Takyi said, his short hair dyed in a golden hue for the Tokyo Games.  As a panting Avila retreated to his corner after the final bell, 20-year-old Takyi jumped up on the ropes to salute his Ghanaian team mates in the stands, then pranced over to his corner to show off with a few push-ups. ""I want boxers in my division to see me,"" he said about his youthful display. ""I'm the best and I will be the best ever. I'm going to do something, I'm going to make a great history."" Elsewhere, Filipino middleweight Eumir Marcial knocked out Armenia's Arman Darchinyan with a right hook to cruise into the semi-finals, securing him at least a bronze medal. ""It's like a dream come true,"" Marcial said of his guaranteed medal.  ""When I was young and started boxing we talked about this with my father and ... I'm an Olympic medallist now,"" added Marcial, who was trained by his father early on and now works with Hall-of-Fame trainer Freddie Roach in the United States. ""But I want the gold so I will do my best to give my best performance and leave the rest to God.""  In other weight categories, Britain's Pat McCormack advanced to the men's welterweight final by walkover after Ireland's Aidan Walsh pulled out with an ankle injury, taking home a bronze.  In the light-heavyweight class, fellow Briton Ben Whittaker beat Russian Imam Khataev by split decision for a shot at gold.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria ENOSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) -     Matt Wearns's decision as a promising young athlete to choose sailing over Australian Rules football paid off handsomely at the Enoshima Yachting Harbour on Sunday when he was crowned Olympic champion in the men's Laser class.  Wearns started the competition poorly but bounced back with a superb stretch of results in the 10 opening-series races, meaning he just had to start and finish Sunday's medal race to win gold -- by far a bigger prize than a winner's medal in ""footy"", as it is known in Australia.  ""For as long as I can remember, this is all I wanted to do -- to come to the Olympics first and foremost, but to bring home a gold medal as well, so I'm super-stoked to have that dream finally come true; it's all starting to sink in now,"" he told reporters.  The 25-year-old said he had faced a tough choice between his two favourite sports.  ""Growing up in Perth as a kid, you always get into footy and the AFL (Australian Football League), so I was doing that with the sailing when I was a bit younger, and I had to decide to come to the sailing side,"" the 25-year-old said, adding that he sometimes questioned his choice.  ""There's definitely times in your career when things haven't been going well where you start to wonder whether you made the right decision, but we stuck with it and I'm super, super happy I have."" Wearns said he intended to make it to the Paris Olympics in 2024 to defend his crown.  ""That's the plan at the moment. Only three years between the Games now so it's going to be quite quick, but I feel I'm finally where I want to be in the sport."" If nothing else, Sunday's gold puts paid to any regrets Wearns may have had about choosing sailing over footy.  ""I'm pretty happy I did now, I'm an Olympic gold medallist!"" he said.

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Swimming - Women's 50m Freestyle - Medal Ceremony - Tokyo Aquatics Centre - Tokyo, Japan - August 1, 2021. Sarah Sjoestroem of Sweden with her silver medal REUTERS/Marko Djurica TOKYO (Reuters) -     Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom savoured an Olympic 50m freestyle silver medal on Sunday after a fightback from injury that she said had been the challenge of her life. The 27-year-old world record holder broke her elbow when she fell on ice in February, a slip that threw her Tokyo participation into doubt. She had surgery immediately, regularly posting details of her rehabilitation on Instagram, and completed the comeback by claiming the silver. ""This is one of my biggest achievements in my career,"" declared Sjostrom, who was unable to put a swimming cap on without help a few months ago. ""I've been winning a lot of medals and breaking a lot of world records, but this has been the toughest challenge so far. ""In my first swim a couple of weeks after my surgery, I didn't believe in myself. ""We didn't know if I would make it all the way to the podium -- we were just like, 'maybe a final if I can',"" added the 2016 100m butterfly champion. ""It has been a really hard journey, but it has definitely made me even tougher as an athlete."" She told SVT television in June that she had lost almost four cm of muscle mass around her right biceps after the surgery, subsequently regaining much of it. The Swede -- winner of eight world championship golds between 2009 and 2019 -- was back in the pool by March for light exercise. She missed the European championships in May, returning competitively in June. Denmark's Pernille Blume, the 2016 Olympic champion, was one of Sjostrom's pre-pandemic training partners and took Sunday's bronze medal. She too had a comeback story, after contracting COVID-19 earlier in the year and suffering a wrist injury, and appreciated what her friend had been through. ""I am so amazed by you. You managed to progress from heats to semis to final,"" she said.  ""It has been a crazy year. To be honest I never expected anything less from you, really inspiring to race alongside you.""

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Volleyball - Men's Pool B - Brazil v France - Ariake Arena, Tokyo, Japan – August 1, 2021. Leal of Brazil in action with Barthelemy Chinenyeze of France. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins TOKYO (Reuters) -     Defending Olympic champions Brazil edged France in a marathon five-set battle at the Ariake Arena on Sunday to finish second in Pool B in the men's volleyball preliminary round in Tokyo. World number one Brazil, who also needed five sets to beat Argentina, took the opening set but the second was a see-saw battle that lasted nearly an hour, the teams sharing 15 set points between them before France eventually came through. In the deciding set Brazil saved four match points before winning 25-22 37-39 25-17 21-25 20-18 to give themselves a boost ahead of the quarter-finals. Wallace de Souza led the way for Brazil with 23 points while Ricardo Lucarelli and Yoandy Leal added 21 and 20 points, respectively. Lucas Saatkamp added another 19 and had a game-high seven blocks. ""I feel good with the victory,"" De Souza said. ""I think all the team members have become more confident after today's game. ""We will play well in the next game, though we don't know who we will compete against."" The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) team beat bottom side Tunisia 25-20 25-22 25-16 to finish top of Pool B. Brazil had the same 4-1 record but finished second after being taken to five sets in two of their wins. ""It was not simple because we knew that we had to win the first three sets. It was very important for us to win these sets first to take first place,"" Maxim Mikhaylov, ROC's top scorer with 15 points, said. Earlier, Pool A leaders and world champions Poland beat Canada 25-15 25-21 25-16, with Bartosz Kurek and Wilfredo Leon combining for 33 points. ""Canada took risks from the second set, so our rhythm was disturbed. Nevertheless, we could get back into our game,"" Poland's Michal Kubiak said.

The victory for the top-seeded Czech team and three-time Grand Slam champions put an end to Bencic's dream of making it a Swiss double golden success, after she triumphed in the women's singles final a day earlier over Krejcikova and Siniakova's compatriot Marketa Vondrousova. But it helps continue a dream summer for Krejcikova who took home both the women's singles and doubles trophies at this year's French Open. She and Siniakova also won the 2018 French Open and Wimbledon.

"TOKYO (Reuters) -     A horse competing with Swiss rider Robin Godel at the Tokyo Olympics was put down on Sunday after appearing lame at a fence in the middle of the cross-country course the day before the medals ceremony for equestrian eventing. The race was stopped and other riders, who were racing at speeds of around 34 kph on the 4.4-km obstacle course, were halted so the 14-year-old gelding called Jet Set could be taken from the scene. ""The horse received immediate veterinary attention at the fence and, after an initial assessment, was transferred by horse ambulance to the onsite Veterinary Clinic,"" the equestrian federation FEI said in a statement. ""Sadly, ultrasound scans revealed an irreparable ligament rupture in the lower right limb, just above the hoof, and on humane grounds and with the agreement of the owners and athlete, the decision was taken to put the horse to sleep."" FEI added that samples had been taken from the horse and a post mortem would take place, in line with its rules. In a statement on Instagram, Godel said that Jet Set ""passed while doing what he loved most: galloping and jumping obstacles.""

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Swimming - Men's 4 x 100m Medley Relay - Final - Tokyo Aquatics Centre - Tokyo, Japan - August 1, 2021. Caeleb Dressel of the United States reacts during the race REUTERS/Carl Recine     TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY TOKYO (Reuters) - Caeleb Dressel brought the curtain down on his Tokyo Games by winning a fifth gold medal on Sunday and said that the high expectations, pressure to perform and a rollercoaster ride of emotions had made the Olympics a ""terrifying"" experience. The American won the men's 50m freestyle on Sunday by nearly half a second, a huge margin in modern sprint swimming, and played a pivotal role in the men's 4x100m medley relay win. Dressel won all three of his individual events - the men's 100m butterfly and the 50m and 100m freestyle - plus two relay golds despite a brutal competition schedule that included two days of juggling medal ceremonies with back-to-back races. The 24-year-old, who has now earned a career seven Olympic golds, said the pressure to win on sport's biggest stage is far greater than that at a world championships. ""It's a different type of pressure, I'm completely aware of that now and I'll stop lying to myself,"" said Dressel, who has 13 world titles. ""You have to be so perfect in that moment, especially we had an extra year, so a five-year buildup, a 24-year buildup. ""There's so much pressure. In one moment, your whole life boils down to a moment that could take 20 or 40 seconds. How crazy is that? For an event that happens every four years. ""I wouldn't ever tell myself this during the meet but after looking back, it's terrifying."" Dressel is being compared to American greats Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz, winners of eight and seven gold medals at a single Games, but he said he wants to make his own mark. ""The United States has been dominant for so many years, for me to have my memorable stamp on the sport of course it's special,"" said Dressel, whose Olympic preparations included lengthy drives in Florida to the few pools that were open, and weight training sessions in a coach's garage. ""My goal is not to be Michael, my goal is not to be Mark. ""I feel like I've already exceeded my expectations here, I'm really happy with what I did and had a really fun time being here and know I can be better.""

"FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Europa League - Champions League - Group E - Liverpool v Napoli - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - November 27, 2019  South African rugby international Siya Kolisi on the pitch before the match  REUTERS/Phil Noble CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -     South Africa captain Siya Kolisi says next Saturday’s series decider against the British & Irish Lions in Cape Town is potentially more important than their Rugby World Cup final win over England two years ago. The Springboks levelled the three-match series with a bruising, ill-tempered 27-9 second-test victory over the Lions on Saturday, an ugly contest which stretched over two hours with a large number of stoppages for contentious Television Match Official referrals. A loss for the Boks would have meant a series defeat and that desperation from both sides, with the Lions hoping to complete the job, showed in a bitty display that at times threatened to boil over. ""It was the same pressure we felt at the World Cup, but now it is a bit more because this (a Lions series) only happens every 12 years,"" Kolisi told reporters.  ""It's game on. We are going to go again. Nothing is different. We are just going to try and do what we did today even harder. ""Nothing will change for us. We’ve just got to do things better, and in the set-piece try and win more of our balls and get more dominance in the scrums. Work harder off the ball. And it’s all about who can control the kicking game."" South Africa’s director of rugby Rassie Erasmus had launched an offensive on the match officials following the 22-17 first test loss, and there were plenty of contentious decisions again, though this time they appeared to favour the Boks.  Not least was a potential red card for wing Cheslin Kolbe when he upended Lions scrumhalf Conor Murray in the air, but instead got away with a yellow. Kolisi said the players had put the controversy around Erasmus’s statements to one side and focused only on what they could do on the field. ""As a team, we go back to what we know with the systems, the structures of the team, working on fixes. Every individual looks at what they need to do.  ""That's what we went to because you can't control everything, but what we can apply on the field, that's what we focused on."" Kolisi had said he did not get the same ""respect"" as Lions counterpart Alun Wyn Jones in the first test from Australian referee Nic Berry, but praised New Zealander Ben O’Keeffe for his performance on Saturday. ""Today was better. I went to Ben before, it was great working with him. He came to me afterwards and said 'Thank you’. (Assistant) Mathieu (Raynal) as well, the ref for next week.""

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Fencing - Men's Team Foil - Semifinal - Makuhari Messe Hall B - Chiba, Japan - August 1, 2021. Erwann Le Pechoux of France in action against Kyosuke Matsuyama of Japan REUTERS/Molly Darlington CHIBA, Japan (Reuters) -     France will face the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) for the finals of the men's team foil competition after they beat their semi-final opponents by the skin of their teeth. France beat a feisty Japan, which fresh out of a surprise victory against third-ranked Italy in the quarter-finals refused to concede an easy win.  The final bout started with Japan down by eight points at 40-32, but Kyosuke Matsuyama won ten points in quick succession. But France's Erwann le Pechoux held his ground, taking the final point and finishing the match at 45-42, prompting team mate Enzo Lefort to run onto the piste and give him a bear hug. ""It was like a rollercoaster. It was down, then up, but at the end, this man at my right (le Pechoux) - he can fence under pressure (and) he managed to put the last one - that's everything we ask of him,"" Lefort told Reuters. France will be vying with ROC for the gold medal.  If France wins gold, it will be the eighth for the country in the men's team foil event. ""The ROC team - we don't know them. It's a young team, we never fenced them, so we'll see, we'll manage on the piste,"" Lefort said. The ROC team, which fought neck to neck against the top-ranked United States team and got away with a 45-41 victory, consists mainly of young fencers for whom Tokyo 2020 is the first Olympics. The Russians are defending the gold medal they won in Rio 2016, but with a team consisting mainly of under 21s - including a pair of twins. Only alternate Timur Safin was part of the previous gold winning team. In the previous Rio 2016 Olympics, France had claimed silver and the United States took bronze.

"FILE PHOTO: Tokyo 2020 Olympics -   Tennis - Men's Singles - Quarterfinal - Ariake Tennis Park  - Tokyo, Japan - July 29, 2021. Daniil Medvedev of the Russian Olympic Committee walks off after losing his quarterfinal match against Pablo Carreno of Spain. REUTERS/Mike Segar TOKYO (Reuters) -     The International Tennis Federation (ITF) wants to extend the Olympics schedule for the sport to 11 days from nine to ensure adequate rest for players and to manage hot summer conditions for the Paris 2024 Games and beyond. Organisers moved the start of matches to later in the afternoon midway through the Games' tournament in Tokyo last week after players complained about the stifling weather conditions https://graphics.reuters.com/OLYMPICS-2020/SUMMER-HEAT/bdwvkogrzvm, with men's world number two Daniil Medvedev warning officials a player ""can die"" in the heat.     ""The challenge is that we have nine days to play five events, and we have almost 200 players. The scheduling for the first two days is 48 matches each day, 12 courts with four matches a day,"" ITF President David Haggerty told reporters on Sunday.   ""As you know, it could be a long day, but what we really need is 11 days, and more restful players."" ""This will involve us talking to our other stakeholders and taking them along the journey, and certainly the players have been telling us that it's important to them to be able to train for two or three events.""  ""So I think that that's really the driving force - the athletes' voice, and them wanting to compete.""            Kris Dent, ITF Senior Executive Director of Professional Tennis, said the sport's governing body had taken steps to make sure players were well-rested and to manage challenging weather conditions, such as reducing the number of sets played and introducing tie-breaks.  But organisers were unable to deal with the packed schedule of the Games, with many players competing in both the singles and doubles competitions.   ""The key element really is about player rest...

"Aug 1, 2021; Tokyo, Japan; Robert Finke (USA) with his gold medal for the men's 1500m freestyle during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Summer Games at Tokyo Aquatics Centre. Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports TOKYO (Reuters) -     Robert Finke relied on another late, lung-bursting surge to complete the distance double at the Tokyo Games on Sunday, the U.S. swimmer overhauling Florian Wellbrock and Mykhailo Romanchuk on the home stretch to win 1,500 freestyle gold. The 21-year-old from Tampa, Florida had sat off the leaders for much of the race but hit top gear with a 25.78 seconds last split that took him past his rivals to touch more than a second ahead of Ukraine's Romanchuk with German Wellbrock in third. Finke, who won the 800m free on Thursday with a similar charge from behind, said he was not feeling overly optimistic coming into the final.  ""Honestly, coming into the race I wasn't feeling too good,"" he told reporters. ""I was pretty fatigued but then I realised everyone else in the field was feeling the same way.  ""I was confident in my ability to come home, but not too far into the front end speed. I was lucky to have other guys around me so I wasn't like freaking out."" It had been a similar story in the 800, when he swam in the pack behind Rio champion Gregorio Paltrinieri of Italy. Finke trailed by more than a body length for most of that race but with a dramatic switch of pace pulled himself into contention before coming home 0.24 seconds clear.  He said he could hear his coach Stephen Jungbluth's voice in his head telling him to pick up the pace. ""Especially during the 800 I had coach Jungbluth's voice yelling at me in my head about switching gears and just getting the job done,"" Finke said. Finke said he would now relax and cheer on the rest of the U.S. athletes in the last week of the Olympics. ""I came in not really expecting to get a medal or anything and to come out of it with two golds ... I'm just going to do my best to process this, hang out with my family and team mates,"" he said.

"Aug 1, 2021; Tokyo, Japan; Gold medalist Charlotte Worthington (GBR)bites her medal during the BMX Freestyle during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Summer Games at Ariake Urban Sports Park. Mandatory Credit: Michael Madrid-USA TODAY Sports TOKYO (Reuters) -     They say if you can't stand the heat then get out of the kitchen, but British BMX freestyler Charlotte Worthington was as cool as a cucumber on baking Tokyo morning to claim a dramatic Olympic gold medal on Sunday. With temperatures soaring into the high 30s the former Mexican restaurant chef gambled on executing a trick never managed before in a female BMX competition. When she crash-landed painfully trying to nail a 360 degree backflip -- a head-spinning move that defies the laws of physics -- it appeared she had bitten off more than she could chew. Third last out of nine after her first run and with favourite Hannah Roberts out alone at the top with 96.10 points from a sizzling first run, Worthing needed the ride of her life, and more, to topple the American. Undaunted, Worthington nailed the trick second time round, having kept it a closely-guarded secret all week after managing it in training this week at the Ariake Urban Sport Park. Flowing over the ramps with moves known as barspins and tailwhips she then pulled off a forward flip that probably sealed the deal -- earning her a massive 97.50 from the judges. ""It was incredible. I've not been doing that trick for that long, but we've been trying to find that big banger trick and when we found it we were like, 'I think this is the one',"" Worthington said after snatching gold out of the fire. It was a stupendous moment of sporting drama -- an athlete staking everything on gold or nothing. ""We set the target of the gold medal and it was either go big or go home,"" Worthington, who used to slave away 40 hours a week in a Manchester restaurant cooking fajitas, told reporters. ""I've learned in the years prior to this when competing that if you gamble and give yourself that chance then it can pay off and you'll feel better than if you hold back."" After such a heavy fall in her first run, Worthington showed great composure to try the stunt again -- one she had managed a ""few times"" on the more forgiving rubber surface in training. She said her coach Jamie Bestwick, a trailblazer in BMX freestyle, had given her some simple advice. ""Our mantra throughout this whole thing has just been 'breath', she said. ""I know I can physically do the tricks, you just need to be mentally calm."" British Cycling invests huge amounts of money into track cycling, which starts on Monday, but the performances of the BMX riders had been a revelation. Worthington's gold in the Olympics debut for freestyle came after Bethany Shriever won the BMX women's race and Kye Whyte took a silver. Declan Brooks then added a bronze as he also performed marvels at the BMX park on Sunday. ""I've just cried for the last couple of minutes,"" the 25-year-old Brooks said.

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Sailing - Mixed Nacra 17 - Opening Series - Enoshima Yacht Harbour - Tokyo, Japan - August 1, 2021. Ruggero Tita of Italy and Caterina Banti of Italy in action. REUTERS/Carlos Barria ENOSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) -Australia's Matt Wearn cruised to an easy victory in the men's Laser class at the Enoshima Yachting Harbour on Sunday, making the most of the big lead he built up in the opening races to take the gold.   Croatia's Tonci Stipanovic took the silver medal, with Hermann Tomasgaard of Norway picking up the bronze.  Wearn hit a sweet spot during the 10 opening series races that decided the 10 boats that would contest the medal race, notching two wins and three second-placed finishes to go into the medal race with an unassailable lead.  With the pressure off, the 25-year-old Wearn came second in the medal race to top the overall standings after a superb Olympic campaign on 53 points, with Stipanovic a distant second on 82 and Tomasgaard three points further back.  ""The goal was just to go out and have a clean start and be able to race from there. To be able to do that and just enjoy the race was awesome,"" he told reporters.  ""It was a great experience - nice wind, good waves. When the wind's like this the sport is just amazing and you really start to enjoy it."" The women's Laser Radial medal race is due to take place later on Sunday.  The Italian pairing of Ruggero Tita and Caterina Banti head into Tuesday's medal race in the Nacra mixed class guaranteed a medal after another strong showing.  Tita and Banti racked up four wins and four second-placed finishes in the 12 opening series races to top the overall standings ahead of the medal race, 12 points clear of the British pair of John Gimson and Anna Burnet, but they are not taking anything for granted.  ""In racing, regattas are regattas so you never expect anything, but for sure we are confident in the job we have done the last five years, we have done what we trained for,"" Tita told reporters.  The Nacra class takes place over an opening series of 12 races to decide the 10 crews that will contest the final, and the medal race itself, with scores carried forward from the opening series. The team with the lowest combined score wins the competition.  The Italians have 23 points, with the British team, who are also guaranteed a medal, on 35. The German team of Paul Kolhoff and Alica Stuhlemmer (47 points) are in third, with Australia's Jason Waterhouse and Lisa Darmanin (54 points) fourth.  Cloud Computing helps you do more with less.

"Oops!: Canada’s Pamela Ware slips from the board on her final dive, resulting in a failed dive, during the women’s 3m springboard diving semi-final. — AFP TOKYO: China’s Shi Tingmao advanced to the women’s 3m springboard diving finals in first place at the Tokyo Games, while two-time Olympian Pamela Ware of Canada suffered a surprise exit after she missed her last attempt. The 29-year-old Tingmao finished the first round in seventh, but clawed her way back up to first place, ending with 371.45 points, more than 24 points ahead of her synchronised diving partner Wang Han in second at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre. “At the beginning, I hadn’t adapted to the rhythm of the tournament well. Then I felt a little strained, but I realised that, in fact, the competition is about seeing who can give it a go,” Tingmao, the defending Olympic champion, told reporters. Two-time Olympic medallist, Jennifer Abel of Canada came third with 341.40. Ware was displaying a series of strong dives and ranked fourth at the end of the round three, but late errors including the failed attempt in her last dive meant she tumbled out of contention. “Honestly, I think I’m still in shock right now. I’m kind of emotionless, which is really weird for me because I usually act on my emotions really quickly,” the 28-year-old said. “But I think that if I would have done the dive, I could have possibly hurt myself,” she added on the failed dive. Japan’s Sayaka Mikami, who finished fifth in the preliminary round on Friday, also had to withdraw after she took off wrong on the third dive, and dropped from fourth to the bottom in the standings. The women’s 3m springboard finals will take place today, as China look to extend their winning streak to nine golds in the event. — Reuters WITH rapid advances in the medicine and healthcare field, it has now become possible to address newer and bigger challenges than before, leading to continuous improvement in the field for the benefit of all.

"Eye-catching: A multi-exposure shot showing Nur Dhabitah Sabri performing in the women’s individual 3m springboard event. — Bernama The 22-year-old Dhabitah is not targeted for a medal but the underdog tag may just be the right motivation for her when she takes on 11 of the best 3m female springboard divers in the Olympics final at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre today. She showcased a consistent performance in the semi-finals yesterday to advance into the top-12 women’s individual 3m springboard final as the sixth best. Dhabitah was placed ninth after an opening dive of 63.00 points but a 65.10 in the second attempt saw her moving to fifth. She then maintained her position in the top 10 with identical scores of 63.00 in the next two dives. She managed only 58.50 in her fifth and final attempt but her position in the top 10 was never under threat by that time. She made it to the women’s individual 10m platform in her Olympics debut in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 where she finished ninth. Dhabitah is not expected to upset the fancied Chinese springboard divers Shi Tingmao and Wang Han, who are renowned for their superb consistency and strong entries. Tingmao and Wang Han are expected to turn the final into a private battle after finishing first (371.45) and second (346.85) respectively. Jennifer Abel of Canada, who took silver with Melissa Citrini-Beaulieu of Canada earlier in the week, was the best non-Chinese finisher with 341.40 points. A podium spot is not beyond Dhabitah’s reach if she can rise to the occasion and nail all her five dives. “Of course, every athlete will want to win an Olympics medal after preparing so hard,” said Dhabitah, who was pleased with her semi-final performance yesterday. “But I don’t want to think about what to expect. I want to perform like I do in training and hope luck is on my side too.” The outing yesterday was her best effort on the 3m springboard since she bagged bronze with a career-best 344.40 points in the World Series leg in London two years ago.

"FILE PHOTO: Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Gymnastics Artistic Training - Ariake Gymnastics Centre, Tokyo, Japan - July 22, 2021 Simone Biles of the United States during training REUTERS/File Photo TOKYO (Reuters) -Simone Biles will not compete in Monday's floor exercise final, leaving her with just one more event to win another medal at the Tokyo Games. USA Gymnastics said on Sunday that Biles had withdrawn from the event final for floor and would make a decision later this week on the beam, the one remaining event she is qualified for at this Games.  ""Either way, we're all behind you, Simone,"" USA Gymnastics added in a tweet. https://twitter.com/USAGym/status/1421667062401802240 It was not immediately clear who would take her place.  Biles shocked the world when she withdrew from the team finals https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/gymnastics-biles-out-team-event-can-still-get-medal-2021-07-27 on Tuesday after a single vault, citing mental health issues. She has received an outpouring of support https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/simone-biles-wins-wide-support-after-withdrawal-2021-07-27 from athletes, officials and fans, including former first lady Michelle Obama and International Olympic Commission (IOC) President Thomas Bach. She has since withdrawn from all the other competitions she was eligible for, except the beam, which is scheduled to take place on Aug. 3. The 24-year-old Biles came to Tokyo with high expectations as she gunned for six gold medals, which would have made her the most decorated Olympic woman. She earned a silver from the sidelines in the team competition and later cheered U.S. teammate Sunisa Lee to gold https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/lee-grabs-all-around-gold-us-biles-watches-2021-07-29 in the all-around. Her decision to drop out of three more finals means she won't defend any of the other golds she won in Rio, on vault and floor exercise.  She won a bronze in beam at Rio, the one event she is still entered for in Tokyo. Biles has spoken with remarkable candour about her decision to prioritise her mental and physical well-being as she deals with the ""twisties,"" https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/i-had-twisties-just-like-simone-2021-07-30 where gymnasts are disoriented during their gravity-defying sequences. ""It's honestly petrifying trying to do a skill but not having your mind & body in sync,"" Biles explained in an Instagram story, in which she answered fan questions and shared practice videos.  Biles said that while she usually only suffered from the ""twisties"" on floor and vault, they were now hitting her on everything. ""It's never transferred to bars & beam before for me, it strictly likes floor and vault. Go figure, the scariest two. ""But this time it's on literally every event. Which sucks... really bad.""  She also said it had usually taken around two weeks to clear up when she suffered from them before but she would wait and see. ""Something you have to take literally day by day, turn by turn,"" she wrote. On Sunday, she posted an Instagram story around the time the announcement of her withdrawal was being made. ""Always take a moment to celebrate the beautiful woman you've become, the obstacles you've overcome, the silent battles you've fought and the hard decisions you've had to make,"" she wrote, in black words on a muted background.

"Aug 1, 2021; Tokyo, Japan; Mourad Aliev (FRA), blue shorts, yells at officials after being disqualified in his men's super heavy quarterfinal bout against Frazer Clarke (GBR), red shorts, during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Summer Games at Kokugikan Arena. Mandatory Credit: Andrew P. Scott-USA TODAY Sports TOKYO (Reuters) -     French boxer Mourad Aliev lodged a furious protest with an hour-long ring-side sit-in on Sunday after being disqualified in his super heavyweight quarter-final bout, expressing his contempt by spitting out his mouth guard and punching at a TV camera. His opponent, Britain's Frazer Clarke, suffered cuts above on his face in what the referee deemed an intentional headbutt by Aliev, winning the match with four seconds left in the second round. When the referee motioned for a stop, Aliev flew into a rage, kicking the mouth guard he had ejected from his mouth and making offensive gestures with his arms while pacing around the ring. For the next half-hour, the Moscow-born pugilist remained planted at one corner outside the ring, then departed the arena after a word with a group of suited officials only to return about 15 minutes later to resume his sit-in. ""It's totally unfair - I was winning the match,"" the 26-year-old told a throng of reporters after finally abandoning his spot at the Kokugikan arena in Tokyo. ""I was just stopped without any warning and they just told me that 'you lost' - just like that. So I think it was an act of sabotage,"" he said. The first round had gone to Aliev 3-2. ""I prepared my whole life for this event, so getting mad for something like that is natural,"" he added. Clarke, who secured at least a bronze with the win, said he sympathised with the Frenchman - three years his junior - and that he had walked over to him after the bout to try to calm him down. ""I've been in these situations myself,"" the Briton said. ""Often you're not thinking with your head, you're thinking with your heart and your emotions are all over the place.  Clarke said he had expected a tough match, having lost to him six weeks ago although he noted he had beat him twice in the past. ""He's a good fighter... I didn't want him to damage his reputation or to be rude to the judges and officials, because they're only doing their job. I was trying to give him a bit of advice from an experienced and senior head. ""These things happen. I've had a lot of downs in my career, a lot of ups and a lot of downs. This is a down for him. I know him, he's a good person, I believe he will be a champion,"" Clarke said.

"FILE PHOTO: Cycling - 2020 UCI Track Cycling World Championships - Men's Keirin Final 1-6 - Berlin, Germany - February 27, 2020. Harrie Lavreysen of the Netherlands celebrates after winning. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel TOKYO (Reuters) -     The track cycling events begin at the Izu velodrome, 130km south west of Tokyo, on Monday. Here are five riders to watch: Kenny is the golden girl of British track cycling and has win every Olympic event she has entered -- winning the team pursuit and omnium at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. Since Rio she has married her husband Jason, who will be trying to add to his six Olympic gold medals on the Izu track, and become a mother to son Albie. The year-long delay to the Games might well have allowed Kenny, Britain's most-decorated female Olympian, to return to her best form after injury problems at the start of 2020 and this time she has three golds to go for. Not only will she be powering the team pursuit squad, in what looks like being a showdown with the Americans, and the multi-event omnium in which she is a big favourite, she will compete in the Madison with Katie Archibald. The 24-year-old Dutch flyer has become the dominant force in the sprint events and looks favourite to knock Britain's Jason Kenny off his perch in sprint, team sprint and keirin. He was unstoppable at the Berlin world championships in 2020, winning gold in those three events. With so few competitions since it is difficult to judge form but Britain's former track great Chris Hoy believes a Dutch sprint squad led by Lavreysen will be the ones to beat. ""I think if everything goes to the form book then it would be a huge surprise if Harry Lavreyson or Jeffrey Hoogland didn't win the men's sprint,"" Hoy said. ""They have consistently been head and shoulders above the rest of the world for the last four years, making less and less tactical errors."" The 33-year-old is level with Hoy as Britain's greatest Olympian in terms of gold medals with six. He swept three golds in Rio -- sprint, team sprint and keirin -- but his form at last year's Berlin world championships was poor and he failed to medal. Kenny has proven time after time, however, that when the Olympics comes around, he raises his game and may well do again in probably his last Games. A tragic accident ended the glittering career of German sprint great and Rio champion Kristina Vogel, but in 23-year-old Hinze they have a worthy successor. She almost quit the sport because of back problems in 2017 but coach Aleksander Harisanow corrected her posture on the bike and she has thrived ever since. At the Berlin world championships last year she won three golds and will be a huge threat in team sprint, sprint and keirin in her maiden Olympics. Made history in 2020 when she became the first Japanese woman to be crowned as a world track cycling champion as she won the omnium in Berlin. The 24-year-old from Saitama will have her work cut out to repeat that feat but on home boards could be a threat to favourites Kenny and Dutchwoman Kirsten Wild.

"Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Athletics - Men's 100m - Round 1 - OLS - Olympic Stadium, Tokyo, Japan - July 31, 2021. Trayvon Bromell of the United States reacts after competing in Heat 2 REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson TOKYO (Reuters) -     Trayvon Bromell, the fastest in the world this year and favourite to win the Olympic men's 100 metres gold, sneaked through the first-round heats as a fastest loser on Saturday, pouring even more intrigue into Sunday's final. The American posted 9.77 seconds last month and, in the absence of banned world champion Christian Coleman, arrived as the man most likely to regain the blue riband title for the United States for the first time since 2004. But he got a terrible start in the second heat and was labouring to make ground behind winner Enoch Adegoke of Nigeria (9.98 seconds). Bromell finished a ragged fourth in 10.05 seconds - with only the first three progressing automatically. He faced an anxious wait through the remaining five heats but went through safely as the quickest of the three fastest losers. With the retirement of triple champion Usain Bolt, the U.S. are desperate to regain the most prestigious title of the Olympics, having last triumphed via Justin Gatlin in Athens. Ronnie Baker, who posted 10.03 in the opening heat, and Fred Kerley, 9.97, both looked good, while Canada's Andre de Grasse, bronze medallist in 2016, was the fastest qualifier with 9.91 seconds.  Jamaica's slim-looking hopes of continuing their streak are now resting on former world champion Yohan Blake (10.06) and Oblique Seville, who ran an equal personal best of 10.04, after trials winner Tyquendo Tracey did not make the start line. Lamont Marcel Jacobs had an explosive start en route to an Italian record of 9.94 while Australian Rohan Browning ran a personal best to win the final heat in 10.01. Kenya's Mark Otieno was pulled from the heats hours before the start after a positive doping test. That left Ferdinand Omanyala as the lone contender for Kenya - he also served a 14 month doping ban from 2017 - and he advanced by tying his own national record of 10.01. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has a personal best of 9.86, was disqualified after a false start. The semi-finals and finals both take place on Sunday evening, local time, in Tokyo.

"PETALING JAYA: The battle is not over as far as Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik are concerned. The world No. 9 insist that their candles are still burning bright as they intend to fight with all their might in the bronze-medal playoff against Indonesia’s Mohammad Ahsan-Hendra Setiawan at the Musashino Forest Sports Plaza in Tokyo today. Aaron-Wooi Yik’s hopes of winning an elusive gold for Malaysia have been dashed after going down 22-24, 13-21 to China’s Li Junhui-Liu Yuchen in the semi-finals yesterday. They had entered the match with sheer confidence after having dumped world No. 1 Kevin Sanjaya-Marcus Fernaldi of Indonesia a day earlier but they found the towering world No. 6 Junhui-Yuchen too hot to handle. They did well to keep up with the blistering pace set by the Chinese in the opening game but fell behind in the second game. They are determined to prevent the national badminton team from going home empty-handed for the first time since Athens 2004. And they do not want to join the list of other Malaysian pairs who came up short in the bronze medal playoffs. Soo Beng Kiang-Tan Kim Her (Atlanta 1996), Choong Tan Fook-Lee Wan Wah (Sydney 2000) and Koo Kien Keat-Tan Boon Heong (London 2012) all failed to convert their playoffs into medals. Against the three-time world champions Ahsan-Hendra, the stats are not looking too promising either as Aaron-Wooi Yik have only won once in eight meeting, with their recent defeat in the group stage a few days ago. However, Aaron said he and Wooi Yik would not let negative thoughts get the better of them. “We have to stay positive because there’s another crucial match for us tomorrow (today) and we hope that we can win a medal for Malaysia,” said Aaron. “This is our very last match in Tokyo, we have got to give our all. “No matter how many times we have lost to them, we need to head into the match like it’s 0-0 (for the head-to-head record).” Wooi Yik, who is the nephew of Beng Kiang, can’t bear the thought of going home empty-handed. “Having reached this stage, we really want to try and win something... we want that bronze now,” he said. “We’re not going to hold anything back and play our hearts out.” Heo Kwang-hee (Kor) vs Kevin Cordon (Gua); Viktor Axeksen (Den) vs Shi Yuqi (Chn); Anthony Ginting (Ina) vs Anders Antonsen (Den); Chen Long (Chn) vs Chou Tien-chen (Tpe).

"THE Tokyo Games is entering into the second week and the five-ring logo is everywhere to be seen. No, it’s not only on the flags or signages but the tattoo on the skin of countless athletes competing in Tokyo. It has become a rite of passage for many athletes with Olympic experience to get the five rings synonymous with the Games embossed on their body in some form. For an athlete, just getting to the Olympics is often a lifelong quest and one needs to dedicate years of training to hone their craft to reach this goal. World No. 1 ranked recurve archer Brady Ellison got into the tattoos fad following the 2008 Beijing Olympics where he got silver in the team event. He has the five Olympic rings displayed on the outside of his right forearm and also a Bible verse “The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the Lord.” It’s also to signify his quest to win the gold after striking silver and bronze in previous appearances. “It’s one of the things you see all the cooler Olympians having. I feel like the Olympic rings is the one tattoo that only we can get,” said Ellison, who is shooting for a place in the quarter-finals today. And of the many tattoos on parade, none is more striking than Britain’s breaststroke star Adam Peaty’s ( Peaty got the tattoo after the Rio de Janeiro Games, where he bagged Britain’s first gold medal by twice breaking his own world record in the men’s 100m breaststroke event. “This tattoo represents not fearing who I am up against,” said Peaty, who holds the top 20 fastest times in 100m breaststroke history. American swimming superstar Caeleb Dressel also deserves a gold medal for his striking tattoos. Dressel, who had won two gold medals in Tokyo, has a fullly inked left arm. There is an alligator, a black bear and the American flag on his left arm. And not forgetting the Olympic rings adorning his right arm. “I was born and grew up in Florida, so this made sense. I swim for a living as well,” said Dressel, explaining his alligator tattoo. Malaysian swimmers like Welson Sim, Siow Yi Ying and Leung Chii Lin also have tattoos on their bodies after gracing the Olympic stage. Golfer Gavin Green also had the iconic rings on his arm to commemorate his debut in Rio. “The road to Rio was very memorable indeed. As I only turned pro in 2015, I had only about a year to go for it. It was a short time but I am very happy I managed to do so. Frankly, it wasn’t on my radar at all in the beginning. “I wanted to have something to remind me of all the hard work,” said Gavin.

"WHEN I first told my medical colleagues that I would be travelling 14 hours to Tokyo, they looked at me with a bit of surprise, then hesitantly told me simply to “be safe.” It is the same reaction I have often received when jetting off to cover a natural disaster, like the earthquake in Haiti, or a conflict, like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This time, however, the mission was to report on how people from all over the globe would converge for the Olympic Games in a city under a state of emergency due to the pandemic. Even under the best of circumstances, planning to host the Olympics is one of the most challenging logistical events on the planet. In the middle of an unfolding pandemic, it seemed nearly impossible. But after postponing the Games for a year, the Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided the Games must go on. And so they are – but they’re very different: strange and eerily quiet. When I attended one of the first competitions, the women’s football match between the United States and Sweden, there were only about 50 spectators allowed in the stadium built for 48,000. There was no traffic on the streets, no vendors, and no lines. There were handwashing stations, temperature checks and plexiglass partitions – all of which probably make only a small difference controlling this virus. There was no proof of vaccination required either. The most effective measure was the absolute requirement for masks, which security diligently checked to make sure were properly fitted around our mouth and nose. There was distant fan noise piped in and a smattering of applause after remarkable plays. The only time there was any significant noise was when a team scored. That is when the music blared – so loudly it was as if they forgot to turn down the volume, given it no longer had to compete with the tens of thousands of cheering fans. On the night of the opening ceremonies, it was a flurry to get into the stadium. Protests echoed from around the outside, but once I got in, the full beauty of architect Kengo Kuma’s creation sunk in. Majestic and perfectly placed under a delightful night sky, it was filled with years of past planning and future potential. It was a caged animal raring to run. On its biggest night, the night of the Opening Ceremony, however, it is tame, quiet and slumbering. You could almost imagine all the amazing events it will contain, full of cheering voices and smiling faces. Just not tonight. Still, that didn’t take away from watching the athletes parade out country by country, waving to a nonexistent crowd, but still with smiles emitting from underneath their masks. Fireworks illuminated rows and rows of empty seats. It was a study in contrast. A public health emergency that was at the same time a mental health balm. I think it’s fair to say the pandemic has been giving the Japanese government and the IOC a fair amount of heartburn since it first reared its head. So Olympic and government officials devised a pandemic playbook to make the Games as safe as possible – even if they were always under threat of being cancelled outright. All of these measures have not cleared the metaphorical cloud that continues to hang over the city as the world waits to see how this global event will fare in the face of a pandemic. The major question looming is: Will these now-small number of positive cases show that the protocols outlined in the playbook are working, or will the numbers spike up, underscoring the feeling that holding the Olympics was ill-advised in the first place?

"THE Olympic Games is supposed to highlight excellence, unity and good sporting behaviour — of what’s exemplary, of what’s outstanding and noble. Not only by the athletes alone but the whole sporting community. Sadly at this Tokyo edition, some of our keyboard warriors at home have gone overboard – and smeared the spirit of Olympism with nasty remarks. Hiding behind the screen, these cyberbullies trolled, showed no guilt and shame in undermining the country’s representatives at the Tokyo Games. They attacked the nation’s top mixed doubles shuttlers Chan Peng Soon and Goh Liu Ying after the duo’s humbling exit from the group stage on Monday. The world No. 7 had won a historic silver medal five years ago at the Rio Olympics, so naturally there were expectations on them – but they simply did not deserve the scathing attack. It was absolutely pitiful. As a sports journalist, it saddened me to see the way Peng Soon and Liu Ying were ridiculed. Giving an opinion of how they had fared is acceptable but to take it to a personal level is wrong. Imagine if you are called names! One distasteful comment suggested that the pair should have entered the Paralympic Games to stand a better chance of winning medal, referring to Liu Ying’s longstanding injury concerns. With a strong social media following, Liu Ying’s fame has certainly come with a price as another unpleasant comment directed to Liu Ying read: “While athletes from other countries are focusing on the game, GLY has focused on becoming a celebrity.” There are many other remarks, which I’m even ashamed to mention. Don’t they know the blood, sweat and tears these athletes had shed? Don’t they know the difficulties these athletes had to go through in this physically demanding sport, more so, under the quarantine period? Don’t they remember the time when these veterans had made the country proud on the international stage? Peng Soon, for instance, was not even able to return home to see his wife and four kids for more than two months before the Olympics although his house is just several minutes drive away from the Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM) because of the quarantine rules. As for Liu Ying, it has been nothing but an extraordinary journey to make a strong comeback after two major surgeries back in 2014 and 2017. She could have taken the easy way out by hanging up her racquet after the Rio Games, but she persevered and made her way back as one of the best mixed doubles players in the world and subsequently earned the nod to represent Malaysia in Tokyo. In doing so, Liu Ying had created history as the first female shuttler to compete in three Olympics, a task that many may find it hard to emulate. Fortunately, there are many Malaysians who stood by them. And rightly so. Having covered the sport for many years, I truly understand the hardship these shuttlers had to go though. They know when they have played below par and are able to accept constructive criticisms but everyone has a limit. Who can tolerate insults that are uncalled for? I’m glad chef de mission Lee Chong Wei has stood up for them. You may think it’s cool to mock athletes or anyone else for that matter. But it’s not cool at all.

"IN less than a week, all eyes will be on Japan, a country that promises the best Olympics action despite the Covid-19 challenges. In Malaysia, there is one burning question – can we finally nail our first gold medal? Or maybe even two? We have been sending a team to the Olympics since the 1956 Melbourne Games and we struck our first medal when badminton was introduced as an Olympics sport at the 1992 Barcelona edition. That was when the famous Sidek brothers – Razif and Jalani – won a men’s doubles bronze medal but our neighbours Indonesia upstaged us to take their first-ever Olympics golds through lovebirds Alan Budi Kusuma (men’s singles) and Susi Susanti (women’s singles.) Indonesia have gone on to add another five golds in badminton. Malaysia, meanwhile, have collected a total of 11 medals since then – eight from badminton, two from diving, and one from cycling – but have not seen the glitter of gold. Lee Chong Wei was the top performer, of course, with three silvers from the last three editions in Beijing (2008), London (2012) and Rio de Janeiro (2016.) Rio was a Games to remember when we nicked four silvers (three badminton, one diving) and one bronze (cycling). There will be 30 Malaysian athletes in Tokyo, two fewer than in the Rio team but the smaller number does not in any way mean poorer quality. Indonesia, with their huge population, are only sending 28 athletes. What matters is quality. On paper, we stand a chance in cycling, diving, archery, and badminton. Rio bronze medallist Azizulhasni Awang has been shaping up so well. His physique is more impressive now, he has a better bike, he has focused on nutrition and he is even taking his own pillow and specially designed mattress to make sure he gets a good night’s sleep. One has to just read his Facebook posting filled with war cries and positive sayings. It’s so motivating and inspiring that even I have restarted my morning runs (although that’s on hold no thanks to the Covid-19 restrictions). He is determined and positive, I do hope Azizul’s effort will be rewarded with the gold he is looking for. It will not be easy as his taller and bigger opponents in cycling are ridiculously strong too but he has beaten them all before and the Pocket Rocketman is not one to be intimidated. In diving, we can count on pool darlings Pandelela Rinong, Leong Mun Yee and Cheong Jun Hoong to overcome the strong Chinese divers for the top prize. For once, badminton may not be our forte. But there is Lee Zii Jia. Malaysia probably would have discarded badminton as a medal contender if not for the strong showing by Zii Jia en route to winning the All-England title in March. And based on the draw, this could be his potential pathway to the final - defending champion Chen Long of China in the last 16, second seed Chou Tien-chen of Taiwan in the quarter, Anthony Ginting of Indonesia or Anders Antonsen of Denmark in the semis, and either Kento Momota of Japan or Viktor Axelsen of Denmark in the final. Besides Zii Jia, there are the young and dangerous Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik in the men’s doubles; old-timers Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying, who are equally determined to go one step better than their silver-medal effort in Rio; and Soniia Cheah and Lee Meng Yean-Chow Mei Kuan who want to make a difference in the women’s events. The morale of the national badminton team is also high, largely due to the positive vibe that has been instilled by coaching director Wong Choong Hann and his team since he took over in late 2018. The others in the contingent are not expected to do well but don’t write off top archer Khairul Anuar Mohamad. I believe he has the potential to pull off a surprise. He has the experience and has consistently shown improvement under Korean coach Lee Jae-hyung - he just has to believe in himself. For the first time, there are more Malaysian women athletes in the Olympics, it does not matter that some of them are there as wildcards. Their presence in the Olympics itself is an indication of an achievement that many of us can only dream about. The nation will come together again to rally behind the athletes and pray for their safety as they battle for honour and against Covid-19 in this unprecedented Olympics. I was at the 2004 Athens Olympics and watched Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia being crowned as the men’s singles champion. He shed tears of joy while we were all heartbroken as Malaysia returned empty-handed that year. We came so close in Rio. Will we finally shed tears of joy this time?

"THE Malaysian contingent will leave for their Olympic Games assignment without their chef de mission for the first time. Datuk Lee Chong Wei will stay back as he does not want to take the risk of affecting his health; after all, he had recovered from nose cancer not too long ago and does not want a relapse. He will manage the team from home - probably advising and motivating Malaysia’s 30 athletes – a smaller number of qualifiers compared to the previous edition in Rio four years ago. If that is not bizarre enough, then be prepared for all other unusual situations at the Tokyo Games, which will start on July 23 with the opening ceremony. There won’t be any fans to welcome the march past of athletes from 200 over countries. Over 10,000 athletes will be competing in empty venues, there will be no socialising or training at all on the first three days after arriving in Tokyo as they will be under quarantine. Indeed, it’s going to be a strange Olympics as Japan insists on plodding ahead with the biggest sporting spectacle despite Covid-19 ravaging the country. Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was forced to resort to banning spectators just two weeks before the Games was scheduled to start after announcing that Tokyo’s fourth state of emergency will begin on Monday. Even the opening ceremony on July 23, usually a pompous affair and a symbol of great pride for the hosts, will also be reduced to a television event only. The Japanese organisers are wary of the sentiment of the local residents who had not been in favour of staging an event of this scale in the midst of a national health crisis. The public had valid concerns that the arrival of tens of thousands of athletes, officials and support staff could trigger a new wave of infections. For the athletes, it is basically going to be an extension of their daily routine in isolation. For national diver Pandelela Rinong, she has been living in and out of a training bubble in Bukit Jalil for the past one year and she can’t even return to her home, which is just nearby. It is certainly not good for her mental health but that is what she has to go through to fight for glory for Malaysia in her sport. The worst thing than can happen to Pandelela and other experienced athletes is to make the long arduous trip to Tokyo and not get to compete for breaching the SOPs. They have to be extremely careful. It is not an easy time to be an athlete as you do not just need to be physically and mentally prepared, but also have to constantly worry over your shoulders whether you have been exposed to the virus. Which is why it is timely for top Malaysian officials, including Youth and Sports Minister Datuk Seri Reezal Merican Naina Merican, to preach for fellow Malaysians to get behind the athletes and show support. “I am impressed with them, they went through hell, being far from family but they are doing it for the country,” said Reezal. The public have a right to demand for results but the expectations must also be in balance with the current scenario in a world that is dealing with the pandemic situation last experienced 100 years ago. Criticism is the last thing an athlete should be dealing with right now.

"FILE PHOTO: Japan Self-Defense Forces soldiers stand guard at the athletes' village for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, in Tokyo, Japan, July 22, 2021. REUTERS/Naoki Ogura TOKYO (Reuters) -Tokyo Games organisers said they are investigating after a group of athletes were found drinking alcohol in the Olympic village this week, violating measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The athletes were caught drinking in a park in the athletes' village on Friday night, Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto told a news conference, adding police were later present at the incident. ""We are looking into the matter. We will take appropriate steps based on our findings,"" he said. Police were also at the scene, he said, adding it was not clear what action they took, if any. Muto did not give details of the number of athletes involved or their nationalities. Organisers previously said athletes are permitted to drink alcohol only in their rooms and only if they are alone, as a precaution against COVID-19. Drinking and partying are normally features of life in the Olympic village, as athletes let off steam after years of gruelling training once their competitions end.  But with Tokyo 2020 taking place without spectators and under tight social distancing measures because of the pandemic, athletes have been subject to daily testing and their movements limited inside a ""bubble"".  Some have taken to social media to complain of boredom. Organisers had said they planned to give out 150,000 condoms at the Games, but would tell athletes to take them home rather than use them in the village. Separately, organisers have said six people attending the Games have so far had their accreditation revoked for violating rules imposed to hold the Olympics safely.

"Indonesia's Greysia Polii, left, and Apriyani Rahayu celebrate after defeating China's Chen Qingchen-Jia Yifan during their women's doubles gold medal match in Tokyo. - AP TOKYO: Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu won badminton women's doubles gold on Monday, breaking a Chinese stranglehold and claiming Indonesia's first title of the Tokyo Olympics. The pair beat China's Chen Qingchen-Jia Yifan 21-19, 21-15 to pick up Indonesia's first Olympics medal in women's doubles. ""Twenty years ago, when I was 13 years old, I knew that Indonesia hadn't made any history in women's doubles,"" said Greysia. ""I knew that I was born to be a badminton player, and I had that faith when I was 13 years old that I wanted to make history for Indonesia."" China had won every women's doubles gold but two since badminton's debut at the 1992 Games, but the Indonesians came flying out of the blocks and never let up until the final point.

"TOKYO, Aug 2 ― American Jade Carey won women’s gymnastics floor gold at the Olympics today in a quick upturn in fortune after disappointing in the vault final 24 hours earlier. The 21-year-old from Arizona tumbled her way to a score of 14.366 to take the title from Italian 30-year-old veteran Vanessa Ferrari. There was a rare dead-heat for bronze between Japan’s Mai Murakami and Angelina Melnikova, who led the Russians to team gold last week. For Carey this was rapid redemption after she stumbled on landing on her first vault yesterday and cut a sorrowful figure after her second jump. Those tears of frustration were well and truly dissipated when her technically taxing and expertly executed floor routine earned her gold to continue the USA’s productive time at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre, despite Simone Biles’s absence. ― AFP "
"TOKYO: Italy's Lamont Marcell Jacobs outshone a field of unusual suspects to claim a shock Olympic gold in the men's 100 metres on Sunday, breaking retired Jamaican star Usain Bolt's 13-year hold on the blue riband event. Jacobs, 26, timed a European record of 9.80 seconds, with American Fred Kerley taking silver in 9.84sec in one of the most understated major championship 100m races of recent times. Canada's Andre de Grasse, a bronze medallist at the 2016 Rio Games, repeated the feat in 9.89sec. The athletes were introduced in a dramatic light show – the stadium floodlights were shut off and 12 projectors cast 3D images of the world, zooming in to the Tokyo skyline, and then the name of each sprinter. The lights came back on, swiftly followed by a horrendous false start for Zharnel Hughes in lane four, the Anguilla-born Briton not even bothering to question his disqualification. Dressed in light blue singlet and lycra shorts, the US-born Jacobs, in lane three, made a good start, held his nerve through the drive phase and powered through to the line. Jacobs joyously ran into the arms of Italian teammate Gianmarco Tamberi, who had just shared gold in the men's high jump and was waiting at the finish line. The race, run in stifling temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius (84 Fahrenheit), had a distinctly underwhelming build-up and feel to it as hot favourite Trayvon Bromell bombed out of the semi-finals in which China's Su Bingtian and Jacobs unexpectedly set Asian and European records respectively. The Tokyo Olympics are the first since Athens in 2004 to take place without Bolt, who went on to win three consecutive Olympic 100m titles in Beijing, London and Rio de Janeiro, as well as three straight 200m crowns. And for the first time since the 2000 Sydney Games, there was no Jamaican in the final, Bolt's long-time former teammate Yohan Blake failing to qualify from his semi-final. The field was instead filled with a raft of relatively unknown sprinters, with Jacobs' main claim to fame a European 60m indoor title earlier this year. The 100m in Tokyo, and the circus around it, has arguably been a pale imitation of Bolt's glory years during which the charismatic Jamaican not only dominated the sprints but also captivated a truly global audience. While the spectacle that Bolt brought to the blue riband event has been missing since his retirement in 2017, so also has been the emergence of a new generation of sprinting hopes. Many have been lauded as the athlete to fill Bolt's spikes, but no one has yet lived up to the considerable weight of expectation. Added to that, the 68,000-capacity Olympic Stadium in Tokyo had no cheering fans because of coronavirus restrictions in the Japanese capital. Instead there were sparse pockets of athletes and team officials who did their best to create something of an atmosphere at what is normally one of the most widely anticipated events of the entire Games, commanding a huge worldwide television audience.--AFP 5, including 2 foreigners, claim trial to entering Batu Talam forest reserve without permit Sabah MP suggests compulsory Covid-19 vaccination, single dose for those in rural areas "
"Denmark's Viktor Axelsen (left) celebrates with his coach Kenneth Jonassen after beating China's Chen Long to win the men's singles gold in Tokyo. - AFP TOKYO: Denmark's Viktor Axelsen won Olympics badminton gold on Monday in Tokyo, becoming the first non-Asian man to win the singles title since 1996. World number two Axelsen beat China's defending champion Chen Long 21-15, 21-12, taking control early and never loosening his grip in a relentless performance. Axelsen, who won bronze at the 2016 Rio Games, followed in the footsteps of compatriot Poul-Erik Hoyer, the Atlanta Games champion and the last winner from outside Asia. Hoyer, now world badminton's president, was in the arena to watch Axelsen match his achievement. World number six Chen Long was bidding to emulate legendary Chinese player Lin Dan in retaining his Olympics title. But Axelsen held his nerve with the prize in sight, then broke into disbelieving sobs when Chen hit the final shot long. World number one Kento Momota of Japan exited the competition in the group stage. Indonesia's Anthony Ginting took bronze, beating gutsy Guatemalan world number 59 Kevin Cordon 21-11, 21-13. Anthony's win gave Indonesia two medals on the final day of badminton, after Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu claimed gold in the women's doubles.

"PETALING JAYA: National doubles shuttler Soh Wooi Yik’s career would have ended prematurely if not for the intervention of a former great and a professional club. And yesterday, the 23-year-old, who won a bronze with Aaron Chia in their first Olympic Games outing in Tokyo, took time to appreciate Malaysia’s former national coaching director Morten Frost and Looi Badminton Academy for playing their roles when he was at his career crossroads. Wooi Yik said the three-time All-England champion Frost, who was with Malaysia from 2015-2017, was the man behind his switch to doubles when he was still a budding shuttler after finding little success in the singles. “I started my career as a singles player before making the switch (to doubles) at 16,” said Wooi Yik, who first joined the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) when he was in Form 1. “It was Sir Morten who believed that I had the talent in doubles and tried me out.” Frost’s decision proved to be a masterstroke when Wooi Yik made a swift impact with Ooi Zi Heng at the 2015 Asian junior championships in Bangkok in July (quarter-finals). Two months later, Wooi Yik was paired up with Aaron for the first time and they impressed by finishing as the runners-up at the Malaysian International Youth Under-19 tournament. It earned Aaron-Wooi Yik a place in the world junior meet in November, where they reached the last 16. After Aaron, who is a year older, was promoted to the senior back-up squad, Wooi Yik resumed his partnership with Zi Heng. Wooi Yik-Zi Heng performed fairly well, notching four semi-final appearances with the best – winning a bronze at the Asian junior in Bangkok. But as fate would have it, Wooi Yik suffered an ankle injury which led to him missing his final year to feature in a world junior meet and subsequently being dropped by the BAM. Wooi Yik was devastated but that was when Looi Badminton Academy stepped in to offer him a lifeline. He spent seven months at the club before regaining his spot in the national team. Before the academy came to his rescue, Wooi Yik recounted how he had almost given up the sport. “Winning an Olympics bronze is the greatest moment of my life, so it has been very emotional for me,” said Wooi Yik. “At 18, I was that boy who almost gave up on his badminton career when I was not selected for the national team. “Thankfully, my family members and my uncle (Soo Beng Kiang), were there to encourage me and gave me strength to keep going. “I will not forget another important person, that’s Uncle Looi (owner of the Looi Academy), who offered me a chance to play badminton again. “It was then when I started all over again and now I have become the national No. 1 and an Olympics medallist. I get to be who I am today because of them.” WITH rapid advances in the medicine and healthcare field, it has now become possible to address newer and bigger challenges than before, leading to continuous improvement in the field for the benefit of all.

"PETALING JAYA: National doubles shuttler Soh Wooi Yik’s career would have ended prematurely if not for the intervention of a former great and a professional club. And yesterday, the 23-year-old, who won a bronze with Aaron Chia in their first Olympic Games outing in Tokyo, took time to appreciate Malaysia’s former national coaching director Morten Frost and Looi Badminton Academy for playing their roles when he was at his career crossroads. Wooi Yik said the three-time All-England champion Frost, who was with Malaysia from 2015-2017, was the man behind his switch to doubles when he was still a budding shuttler after finding little success in the singles. “I started my career as a singles player before making the switch (to doubles) at 16,” said Wooi Yik, who first joined the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) when he was in Form 1. “It was Sir Morten who believed that I had the talent in doubles and tried me out.” Frost’s decision proved to be a masterstroke when Wooi Yik made a swift impact with Ooi Zi Heng at the 2015 Asian junior championships in Bangkok in July (quarter-finals). Two months later, Wooi Yik was paired up with Aaron for the first time and they impressed by finishing as the runners-up at the Malaysian International Youth Under-19 tournament. It earned Aaron-Wooi Yik a place in the world junior meet in November, where they reached the last 16. After Aaron, who is a year older, was promoted to the senior back-up squad, Wooi Yik resumed his partnership with Zi Heng. Wooi Yik-Zi Heng performed fairly well, notching four semi-final appearances with the best – winning a bronze at the Asian junior in Bangkok. But as fate would have it, Wooi Yik suffered an ankle injury which led to him missing his final year to feature in a world junior meet and subsequently being dropped by the BAM. Wooi Yik was devastated but that was when Looi Badminton Academy stepped in to offer him a lifeline. He spent seven months at the club before regaining his spot in the national team. Before the academy came to his rescue, Wooi Yik recounted how he had almost given up the sport. “Winning an Olympics bronze is the greatest moment of my life, so it has been very emotional for me,” said Wooi Yik. “At 18, I was that boy who almost gave up on his badminton career when I was not selected for the national team. “Thankfully, my family members and my uncle (Soo Beng Kiang), were there to encourage me and gave me strength to keep going. “I will not forget another important person, that’s Uncle Looi (owner of the Looi Academy), who offered me a chance to play badminton again. “It was then when I started all over again and now I have become the national No. 1 and an Olympics medallist. I get to be who I am today because of them.” PLUS rest service area vendors, workers and community suppliers count on our support to survive.

"SHIZUOKA, Aug 3 ― The Netherlands dominated Britain to win the men’s team sprint today and end Britain’s 17-year-old hold on the gold medal. Roy van den Berg, Harrie Lavreysen and Jeffrey Hoogland set a new Olympic record of 41.369sec in the final, which was more than three seconds faster than Britain’s 44.589. ― AFP  "
"TOKYO, Aug 3 ― Gymnastics superstar Simone Biles stared down the debilitating “twisties” to bravely win Olympic bronze today as Norway’s Karsten Warholm lit up the Tokyo athletics competition with a stunning hurdles world record. Biles pulled out of most of her finals as she battled the disorientating mental block, but she returned in medal-winning style to high excitement at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre. The American four-time gold-medallist, widely considered the “GOAT” (Greatest Of All Time) put in a solid routine including a double backward somersault and double pike dismount, smiling broadly as she was congratulated by her teammates. Biles was lying in the silver medal position until the final competitor, Chinese 16-year-old Guan Chenchen, stepped up and scored 14.633 points to take first place, pushing teammate Tang Xijing into silver. China’s Zou Jingyuan won the men’s parallel bars with 16.233 to add Olympic gold to his two world titles on the apparatus. Earlier, the Olympic Stadium witnessed one of the great races when Warholm shattered his own world record by nearly 0.8sec in an epic 400m hurdles final. The 25-year-old stormed over the line in 45.94 seconds, pushed hard down the home straight by USA rival Rai Benjamin, who took silver in 46.17 ― the second fastest in history. “I dream about it like a maniac,” Warholm said, adding: “I didn’t touch one hurdle. I was even able to find another gear coming home, so ‘wow’. It’s just so big. There was more drama in the women’s long jump, when Germany’s Malaika Mihambo snatched gold from former champion Brittney Reese with her last leap of the competition. Mihambo, 27, was lying in the bronze medal position ahead of her final jump, but powered down the runway to register a season’s best of 7.00 metres and Reese could not respond. Nigeria’s Ese Brume took bronze. “It was, I think, the most exciting women’s long jump competition in history,” said Mihambo. The women’s 200m highlights the evening session, with 100m champion Elaine Thompson-Herah of Jamaica looking to seal an unprecedented “double-double”, after winning both sprints in 2016. World record-holder Armand Duplantis of Sweden is hot favourite in the men’s pole vault final, which will take place without Covid-positive US world champion Sam Kendricks. Elsewhere the USA men’s basketball team, beaten for the first time since 2004 earlier in the competition, saw off Spain 95-81 to reach the semi-finals, while Slovenia crushed Germany to make the last four. In cycling, Germany won the women’s team pursuit gold in a world-record time of 4:04.242 and the Netherlands won the men’s team sprint, with Britain on the losing side each time. Jason Kenny’s silver in the men’s team sprint was enough to equal the British record of eight Olympic medals ― just minutes after his wife, Laura, won her fifth medal in the team pursuit. France’s Bassa Mawem led the men’s combined qualifications with 5.45sec in speed climbing, one of the sports that is making its debut as the Olympics seeks to reach new audiences. Sena Irie became the first Japanese woman to win Olympic boxing gold, defeating Nesthy Petecio of the Philippines on unanimous points to take the featherweight title. Xie Siyi won the men’s 3m springboard diving ahead of Chinese teammate Wang Zongyuan and Britain’s Jack Laugher. Britain grabbed sailing golds in the men’s 49er and Finn, while Brazil won the women’s 49er FX and Italy were crowned champions in the mixed Nacra 17. Belgium beat India 5-2 in the semi-finals of the men’s hockey competition, ending their hopes of a first gold in the sport since 1980. India have another chance in the women’s hockey tournament, when they play Argentina in the semi-finals tomorrow. ― AFP "
"TOKYO, Aug 3 ― The high-tech skinsuit, made from selected materials from a combination of over 40,000 substances that take into account speed and fabric tension, is one of the secret weapons of the national track cycling team as they seek to create history at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics here. National Sports Institute (NSI) chief executive officer Ahmad Faedzal Md Ramli said the Vorteq skinsuit was part of the RM13 million research and development (R&D) project between NSI and the United Kingdom company, TotalSim Ltd. He said that apart from the WX-R Vorteq bikes, which cost over RM300,000 each, that the two national track cyclists Datuk Mohd Azizulhasni Awang and Muhammad Shah Firdaus Sahrom will use in Tokyo, the custom-made skinsuit could also have a big impact on the riders’ overall performance. According to him, the use of the skinsuit, which must be approved by the International Cycling Union (UCI), was specially designed according to the physical size and physiology of an athlete to help maintain his position during racing, thus reduce drag. “It is like a secret weapon. If you can see its technology, it is pretty amazing because it will lock the rider in position. To suit up, it will take three people. It’s definitely a challenge to wear the skinsuit and, after that, the rider’s position will remain (during the race),” he told Bernama recently. Many materials were tested in R&D to obtain the right material for the skinsuit, where we had to make sure the material chosen was the right one to help the athlete perform better the R&D of the skinsuit itself took a long time,” he said without revealing the value of the skinsuits. He said the skinsuits had also undergone wind tunnel testing. Azizulhasni, the 2017 keirin world champion, and Shah Firdaus will begin their Tokyo Olympic campaign in the sprint and keirin events at the Izu Velodrome in Shizuoka from tomorrow. This will be “The Pocket Rocketman” Azizulhasni’s fourth straight Olympic outing since his debut at the 2008 Beijing edition while Shah Firdaus will be making his Olympic bow in Tokyo. Azizul, who finished empty-handed in the Beijing and 2012 London editions, bagged a bronze in keirin at the 2016 Rio edition. Meanwhile, Ahmad Faedzal said the R&D collaboration between the NSI and TotalSim Ltd, which began in 2018, was mainly to focus on the concept of marginal gains. He explained that every aspect that could help maximise Azizulhasni and Shah Firdaus’ potential towards achieving greater heights, including in terms of racing attire, cycling position, bike frame and handle, was taken into consideration. “All these elements will help reduce drag by a small percentage, but they could have a big impact on the riders’ overall performance,” he said. He said that NSI experts and scientists also learned something valuable and gained invaluable experience during the three years of their involvement in the R&D project. “It’s no longer about relying only on the physiological aspects. In certain sports, it’s a combination between physiology and technology the machine is also important,” he added. ― Bernama "

"KUALA LUMPUR: Popular Chinese Canadian singer Kris Wu who was recently arrested in Beijing, China due to rape allegations has had his social media accounts deleted. According to the South China Morning Post, major Chinese companies such as WeChat and Tik Tok have removed his personal and business accounts. Vocal supporters of the 30-year-old pop star also received similar treatment as Weibo shutdown close to 800 of his fans' group chats. Nearly 1,000 other accounts including three belonging to celebrities were also banned or suspended. The reason given by Weibo was that the offending accounts contained misleading remarks. Weibo added that the accounts either ""maliciously justified"" Wu's behaviour or used his legal case to ""pick quarrels"" or ""attack government organisations"". Wu, who is a former member of popular South Korean-Chinese K-Pop group EXO, was taken in by the police on Saturday. This incident follows accusations by an 18-year-old student named Du Meizhu who claimed that the artiste had lured her into having sex after getting her drunk. The shocking revelation produced a snowball effect that saw other women including minors stepping up to make similar allegations against Wu. However, a statement by the police in the Chaoyang district of Beijing on Saturday did not specify which accusation resulted in them opening a legal case. Over a dozen major brands such as Porsche and Louis Vuitton have since cut ties with Wu who has received widespread criticism from the general public. 14,516 Covid 19 cases today; Johor records surge in infections Klang Valley accounts for 63pc of 7,654 new Covid-19 infections 5, including 2 foreigners, claim trial to entering Batu Talam forest reserve without permit Sabah MP suggests compulsory Covid-19 vaccination, single dose for those in rural areas "

"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd's (MPI) net profit surged 49.4 per cent to RM122.35 million in the first half (1H) ended December 31, 2020 (1HFY21) from RM81.89 million previously.

"TAIPEI: Taiwan's defeat of China in the Olympic men's doubles badminton final has reignited nationalist anger on the mainland, sparking boycott calls and resulting in one celebrity losing a string of endorsements from a tea-maker to a sex-toy manufacturer. Tokyo has been Taiwan's best Olympics to date with two golds, four silvers and four bronze. One of those golds came Saturday when Lee Yang and Wang Chi-lin beat China's Li Junhui and Liu Yuchen to claim the island's first Olympic badminton title. China's heavily censored internet has since exploded in anger, especially after Lee dedicated the win to ""my country – Taiwan"" in a Facebook post. Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen also congratulated the players for ""winning our country's first gold medal in badminton"". China's authoritarian leaders regard self-ruled, democratic Taiwan as a part of Chinese territory and have vowed to one day seize the island, by force if needed. Beijing bristles at any international recognition of Taiwan, which competes under the compromise formulation of ""Chinese Taipei"", and cannot use its flag and anthem when its athletes are on the podium. It's not just Lee and Wang who are in the crosshairs – anyone seen to be supporting them is getting similar treatment. Taiwanese entertainer Dee Hsu, a former variety show host who has a huge following in China, has lost several endorsement deals with Chinese brands in recent days after she called Taiwanese players ""national athletes"" on Instagram. On its Weibo account, Shanghai-based ginger tea brand Shou Quan Zhai said it would ""immediately cease all cooperation with Dee Hsu"". ""National interest is above all, (we) firmly uphold the one China principle,"" the brand wrote, referring to Beijing's policy that Taiwan remains part of China. Sex toy manufacturer Osuga was another brand to sever ties with Hsu. ""Osuga firmly supports the unification of our motherland and firmly opposes all comments and actions that attempt to split the country,"" it wrote on Weibo.  Taiwanese pop singer Jolin Tsai also stoked online anger in China after she shared photos of the badminton duo and other players on social media.  The hashtag ""Taiwan independence Jolin Tsai"" began trending on Weibo with comments calling for Chinese state media to blacklist her. China is going through an intensely nationalist period under President Xi Jinping and consumer boycotts of brands have become commonplace, often whipped up and supported by state media. Taiwan is a topic that evokes especially strong sentiment and celebrities who step out of line often find themselves blacklisted.

"KUALA LUMPUR: A 46-year-old housewife could not hold back her tears when she pleaded for a minimum sentence for insulting the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on her Facebook account three months ago.  Rosmawati Mohd Zain had earlier pleaded guilty to the offence when she was charged before Sessions Judge M. M Edwin Paramjothy today.  As the sound of crying rang across the courtroom, Rosmawati said she was remorseful and promised not to repeat the same offence again.  ""I was so stressed due to the hardship we are all facing and expressed it in my Facebook posting.  ""I hope the court can hand down a very minimum fine against me… my children need me,"" said the mother of four.  Deputy public prosecutor Noor Dayana Mohamad, however, pressed for a deterrent sentence against the accused who was unrepresented.  The court later fined Rosmawati RM9,000 in default six months jail.  Rosmawati was charged with insulting the King on her Facebook account 'Rosmawati Mohd Zain'.  She was accused of uploading a post with the intent to annoy other people about 7pm on May 25 this year.  The content was read by another Facebook user at the Cyber Crime and Multimedia Investigation Division, Commercial Crime Investigation Department, Bukit Aman police headquarters, here, at 1.06pm on June 1.

"HONG KONG: Hong Kong online news outlet Initium announced it was relocating to Singapore on Tuesday citing fading press freedoms, the first local media to quit the financial hub as authorities crack down on dissent. The announcement came the same day that veteran broadcaster Steve Vines and Kacey Wong, one of the city's best known political artists, also separately confirmed they had left Hong Kong because of declining freedoms. ""Over the past six years, the road to freedom has become tougher and more dangerous, the world is increasingly polarised and antagonistic,"" Initium's chief editor Susie Wu wrote in an article commemorating the outlet's sixth year anniversary. She cited Hong Kong's steady slide down annual press freedom ranking lists and the rise of ""little pinks"" – staunch nationalists – in mainland China. Initium is a comparatively small Chinese-language outlet with some 60,000 paying subscribers.  But its departure illustrates the concerns many media outlets have about their future in Hong Kong, a city which was once a bastion of free speech in China. ""We believe no matter where we are, as long as the freedom in our hearts is connected, we can create larger space for freedom,"" Wu wrote. China is currently remoulding Hong Kong in its own authoritarian image after huge and often violent democracy protests two years ago. A sweeping national security law imposed last year has criminalised much dissent and authorities have embarked on a campaign to root out those deemed unpatriotic. Many of the city's most prominent pro-democracy activists have been arrested or jailed. Others have fled overseas. On Tuesday, public broadcaster RTHK confirmed veteran host Vines had left for the UK, blaming what he said was ""white terror sweeping through Hong Kong."" ""The institutions that ensure the liberty of Hongkongers are being dismantled by people who care so little that they don't even flinch when it becomes abundantly clear that the very essence of the place is being destroyed,"" Vines wrote in an email to colleagues, RTHK reported. In a separate interview with Hong Kong Free Press, political artist Wong said he had moved to Taiwan in search of ""100 percent freedom"" because of diminishing freedom in his home city. Multiple international media companies, including AFP, have their regional headquarters in Hong Kong, attracted to the business-friendly regulations and free speech provisions written into the city's mini-constitution. But many media outlets are questioning whether they have a future there. The New York Times moved its Asia hub to South Korea after the law was enacted last year, and others have drawn up contingency plans. Last month the Hong Kong Journalists Association said press freedoms were ""in tatters.""

"TAIPEI: Taiwan's defeat of China in the Olympic men's doubles badminton final has reignited nationalist anger on the mainland, sparking boycott calls and resulting in one celebrity losing a string of endorsements from a tea-maker to a sex-toy manufacturer. Tokyo has been Taiwan's best Olympics to date with two golds, four silvers and four bronze. One of those golds came Saturday when Lee Yang and Wang Chi-lin beat China's Li Junhui and Liu Yuchen to claim the island's first Olympic badminton title. China's heavily censored internet has since exploded in anger, especially after Lee dedicated the win to ""my country – Taiwan"" in a Facebook post. Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen also congratulated the players for ""winning our country's first gold medal in badminton"". China's authoritarian leaders regard self-ruled, democratic Taiwan as a part of Chinese territory and have vowed to one day seize the island, by force if needed. Beijing bristles at any international recognition of Taiwan, which competes under the compromise formulation of ""Chinese Taipei"", and cannot use its flag and anthem when its athletes are on the podium. It's not just Lee and Wang who are in the crosshairs – anyone seen to be supporting them is getting similar treatment. Taiwanese entertainer Dee Hsu, a former variety show host who has a huge following in China, has lost several endorsement deals with Chinese brands in recent days after she called Taiwanese players ""national athletes"" on Instagram. On its Weibo account, Shanghai-based ginger tea brand Shou Quan Zhai said it would ""immediately cease all cooperation with Dee Hsu"". ""National interest is above all, (we) firmly uphold the one China principle,"" the brand wrote, referring to Beijing's policy that Taiwan remains part of China. Sex toy manufacturer Osuga was another brand to sever ties with Hsu. ""Osuga firmly supports the unification of our motherland and firmly opposes all comments and actions that attempt to split the country,"" it wrote on Weibo.  Taiwanese pop singer Jolin Tsai also stoked online anger in China after she shared photos of the badminton duo and other players on social media.  The hashtag ""Taiwan independence Jolin Tsai"" began trending on Weibo with comments calling for Chinese state media to blacklist her. China is going through an intensely nationalist period under President Xi Jinping and consumer boycotts of brands have become commonplace, often whipped up and supported by state media. Taiwan is a topic that evokes especially strong sentiment and celebrities who step out of line often find themselves blacklisted.  Pop diva A-Mei was famously blacklisted by China for several years after she sang Taiwan's national anthem at a 2000 presidential inauguration. Beijing hosts the Winter Olympics in early 2022. Last week, the International Olympic Committee confirmed both Taiwan and Hong Kong – the Chinese territory which has come under a sustained crackdown on freedoms – remained eligible to send teams. – AFP  Covid-19 daily figures dip for third day in a row My position will be put to the test this September, says PM Nigerian man sentenced to death for murdering Serdang Hospital nurse Great response to walk in vaccination for senior citizens at Spice CC PPV "

"Pandelela Rinong gets off to a shaky start in the women's diving 10m platform preliminary in Tokyo. - AP PETALING JAYA: It was not a good day for Malaysia in the diving pool as medal hope Pandelela Rinong sneaked through to the top 18 semi-finals of the women's individual 10m platform competition at Tokyo Aquatics Centre but it's over for Cheong Jun Hoong. The semi-finals will take place in the morning on Thursday and then, the top 12 will contest in the final in the afternoon. Pandelela had to endure a nervous wait to see whether she could remain in the competition after only earning 28.80 for her fourth dive. It pushed her down to 20th spot with one dive to go. It was at the same venue in May where Pandelela made history for Malaysia by winning the gold in the 10m platform individual at the World Cup. It was, however, a sad day for Jun Hoong as she exited at the Olympics stage after finishing 26th with 251.80 points. Jun Hoong struggled from the start to get her dives right and looked far from the form that saw her winning her a historic title at the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary four years ago. Jun Hoong was also a silver medallist in the 10m platform synchro with Pandelela at the last Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. THE pandemic has presented numerous unprecedented challenges in the past year and despite a challenging 2020, AIA Malaysia has made great strides in helping millions of Malaysians get protected, stay protected and most of all get more out of life.

"That sinking feeling: Cheong Jun Hoong in action during the women’s 10m platform preliminary round at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre. — AP PETALING JAYA: The fight is not over for two-time Olympics medallist Pandelela Rinong as she draws inspiration from American David Boudia’s experience in the men’s 10m platform individual at the 2012 London Olympics. The 28-year-old Olympics medal hopeful survived a scare to pull through to the top 18 semi-finals in the women’s individual 10m platform competition after finishing as the last qualifier with 284.90 points at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre yesterday. Former world champion Cheong Jun Hoong missed the cut for the semi-finals after picking up only 251.80 points in the five-dive competition to finish 26th. Today, Pandelela will join 17 others to fight for the last 12 spots in the final. Yesterday though, she almost had her Olympics medal hopes snuffed out when she failed to control her fourth dive, only earning the lowest score of 28.80 among the 30 participants. And as a result, she tumbled from 10th to 20th spot and then, had to endure a nervous wait after finishing her last dive with 70.40 before it was confirmed that she had clinched the last qualifying spot. Pandelela has never failed to get into the individual platform final in the last two Olympics – in London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. It was in London where she made a superb comeback from outside the top five to snatch a bronze medal. Pandelela also remembers London vividly because it was at this edition that Boudia made a remarkable comeback after barely making the cut for the semi-finals in 18th spot. In the semi-finals, the American roared back to form by finishing third best before producing the performance of his life to beat Qiu Bo and Lin Yue, the two diving powerhouses from China, to win the gold for his nation. Team manager Mae Chen believed Pandelela will perform better in the semi-finals today. “We believe in her ability to fight for a podium. She had a scare (in the fourth dive) when she flipped her body and it was too close to the platform. “Her hair hit the platform. She got scared and lost her focus. “There is still a chance for everybody as they will start fresh for the semis and the final. “Pandelela knows everybody will be rooting for her to fight for a medal,” said Mae. Reigning world champion Chen Yuxi finished on top while Quan Hongchan made two strong last dives to complete a 1-2 finish for China in the preliminaries. Yuxi led from start to finish to score 390.70 points while Hongchan, making her international debut for China, garnered 364.45. American Delaney Schnell kept the pressure on the Chinese rivals with 360.75 points. Cloud Computing helps you do more with less.

"Nima (middle) posing with her brothers at the summit of Mount Everest in May.  Photo: Grace Best/Nima Lhamu Sherpa/dpa  Every time her brothers returned home after climbing mountains, Nima Lhamu Sherpa would hear stories of adventures in the Himalayas. Most of her siblings were climbing guides and had climbed several peaks including Mount Everest. Their stories would fill young Nima's heart with the desire to climb mountains – ​but she wasn't sure whether she would get that chance. On May 12, the 21-year-old eventually realised her childhood dream in style as she set foot on Mount Everest, becoming the eighth sibling in her family to climb Everest. Her success also broke ​the record of most climbs by siblings that her family shared with another Sherpa family. Before Nima, her six brothers – Pemba Gyalzen Sherpa, Pemba Dorje Sherpa, Phurba Thundu Sherpa, Nima Gyalzen Sherpa, Phurba Tenjing Sherpa and Phurba Thiley Sherpa – and a sister, Dawa Diki Sherpa, had already climbed Everest. ""The happy faces of my brothers always led me to believe that mountaineering was fun. My own summit made me realise that it's very dangerous work requiring a lot of hard work, courage and determination,"" Nima tells dpa. The university student says that she was especially afraid while crossing Khumbu Icefall, a section of icefalls and crevasse at an altitude of 5,486m, and had to intermittently take oxygen due to altitude sickness. ""The ascent was comparatively easier. I found descent from the summit very difficult as one ought to get downhill along a steep, narrow ridge with the help of ropes,"" says Nima. Although Nima had never climbed a mountain except Mount Lobuche, she stood up to all the challenges with assistance from her brothers. On the summit, her two brothers Pemba Dorje and Nima Gyalzen were also with her. It was their 21st and ninth ascent respectively. Two other siblings were at the lower camps to guide their expedition. ""I was fortunate that my brothers were there to guide me on every step. I wouldn't have succeeded without their support and guidance,"" says Nima. Phurba Tenjing, one of the siblings who was guiding Nima from the lower camps, says that he was a little afraid about his sister's safety given the tragedy that struck his family two decades back. At that time, one of their siblings, who was also among the Everest summiteers, died while climbing Mount Pumori. ""Since we have already lost a family member in the mountain, I was concerned about her safety throughout the expedition,"" says Phurba Tenjing. One key factor in the family's feat is its involvement in the climbing and trekking business. Five of the siblings are guides who have helped dozens of climbers head up the world's tallest peaks. In Rolwaling, the siblings' village at an altitude of around 4,000m northeast of Kathmandu, a majority of people work in the tourism sector, especially as trekking guides, porters and cooks.

"TOKYO, Aug 5 ― Jamaica’s Hansle Parchment trumped fading world champion Grant Holloway to win the men’s Olympic 110m hurdles gold on Thursday. Parchment, a bronze medallist at the 2012 London Games, clocked 13.04 seconds, with Holloway taking silver in 13.09sec. Another Jamaican, Ronald Levy, claimed bronze (13.10). Holloway burst out of his blocks in blazing sunshine at Tokyo’s Olympic Stadium and built up a lead directly from the first hurdle. The American looked completely in control through 60 metres, but then tied up, allowing a fast-charging Parchment a way back into the race. The 31-year-old Jamaican made no mistake from lane seven, impressing over the final three hurdles and pushing for the line for the first global medal of his career. “The greatest feeling,” Parchment said when asked what being referred to as the Olympic champion sounded like. “I’ve worked so hard. It’s unbelievable that I caught that guy (Holloway). My coach reminded me to run through the line ― and that’s what I did.” Parchment added: “I don’t think a lot of people expected me to win. “I might have to sit for a bit and just absorb the moment, watch other races because there’s always room for improvement.” Holloway defended his race tactics, saying he had only just missed out on Aries Merritt’s world record of 12.80sec by one-hundredth of a second in June using the same methods. “Everybody knows I’m going to get out strong,” the 23-year-old said. “Now it just comes to a point where I’ve got to finish strong. I did it once when I was two shaves off the world record so I know I can do it.” “The big atmosphere got the best of me a little bit,” he said, despite there being no fans in the 68,000-seater Olympic Stadium because of Covid-19 restrictions in the Japanese capital. “But I’m young, I’ve got a lot of races under my belt so I’ll take this with a grain of salt and I keep moving forward. “This was not the outcome that I wanted but it enables me to say I’m an Olympic medallist.” Focus, Holloway said, would now turn to next year’s world championships in Eugene, Oregon. “I love the hurdles and I can’t wait until next year for the world championships in my home town,” he said. “I think that’s going to be really good for me.” ― AFP "
"COMMENTARY, Aug 5 — Our days and our nights often feel as though they’ve exchanged places. We struggle to get up in the morning, hitting the snooze button as many times as we can, delaying the inevitable. Bleary-eyed, we are incoherent till our first cup of coffee — black and strong — or our third or our fourth... And by the time we feel fully awake, ready to attack a hundred items on our To Do list, it’s time to go to bed. This is when we stay glued to our devices, screens flickering surreptitiously in the dark while our spouses snore, buzzing as though we were full of electricity or energy drinks. Add to this dilemma the past year and a half of the pandemic, and it doesn’t take a genius to guess what some of the worries that could be keeping us up at night are. How to stay safe. How to make ends meet. How to take care of our loved ones. (And of ourselves; let us not forget that.) So yes, partly it could be cabin fever from staying indoors so much but there are many ways to beat the lockdown blues. . A structured morning routine with easy habits to follow to help us get cracking on our day. Well, then surely we could just as easily develop some beneficial evening habits when night falls, to prepare us for bed and a good rest? To let go of the day’s toil and troubles, and to rejuvenate us for a better day on the morrow. According to Andrew D. Huberman, an American neuroscientist and professor at Stanford University, we have “sleep” receptors called Adenosine, which is a molecule that builds up in our body the longer we are awake, thereby creating a need for sleep. The problem comes when we consume too much caffeine during the day or late in the day. Caffeine essentially wakes us up because it blocks the effect of Adenosine. When you consider that the half life of caffeine is around 5-6 hours, our bodies might still retain a quarter of the caffeine from the cup of coffee we had at midday! So while I enjoy my coffee as much as the next person, I now limit my cuppas to the morning. Basically I try to avoid coffee from midday onwards and hopefully sleep better as a reward. Another round of meditation in the evening, to mirror a morning practice, can help us live in the present moment, and that moment might be the few quiet minutes before we turn in. Meditation can be challenging, our minds getting distracted by a million things (the busy day we have had finds its way of creeping in). The practice isn’t about eliminating distractions, of course, but observing these very thoughts that arise in our mind. Some of us may benefit from using meditation apps. There are tons out there, such as Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer and the 10% Happier app based on the Once you’re done with the apps, though, it’s time to... YouTube is my blessing and my bane. Rather than doomscrolling on Twitter, there is video after video of people making, eating and — best of all — talking about food. Which is an escape in itself. For you it might be the involved and passionate debates in your Facebook comment thread. Or the hilarious (to a point) memes on TikTok. Whichever your infinity scroll poison of choice, there is no end to the stream of  Being so relentlessly engaged when we ought to be disengaging and allowing our bodies and our minds to rest? Is it any wonder why we can’t sleep. There’s a simple way out: Just switch off your devices and let those enticing screens go dark. How about reading? An actual book, I mean. Made from paper. Rather than non-fiction (or worse, work reports), which I find causes my mind to race further, trying to analyse and decipher data, at a time when I’m doing my best to slow it down and allow it to rest, my preferred bedtime reading material is a narrative I can get lost in. Fiction fits the bill, whether it’s some fantasy novel or a sublime short story. We follow someone else’s life and adventures and this prepares our minds for our own adventures whilst we dream. Poetry, often too brief to hold our attention during the day (or perhaps we are too distracted), is the perfect length to read, aloud if possible, before we sleep. The cadences of the words spoken aloud and the tenor of our own voices might well be the best lullabies. After reading, you might want to get up and do some light stretching (rather than strenuous exercise). Doing so, we send further signals to our bodies and our mind that we are relaxing ourselves. That we are ready for Dreamland. Circadian rhythms — our physical, mental and behavioural changes that follow a 24-hour cycle — might explain why we get up when the sun rises and get ready for bed after the sun sets. With the lights on at full blast, even in our bedrooms, it’s no surprise that we often stay up till well past midnight and a sensible bedtime. Lowering the lights by switching off the ceiling lights and turning on gentler bedside lamps might help. (Plus: No blue light from flickering screens thanks to Habit #3.) It’s certainly more conducive to the final habit, which is... So you’re now lying in bed. Not quite asleep. Not much else you can do, right? Time to follow your own breath. Whether just observing it or practising a form of relaxation breathing, this action allows you to centre yourself and drift into gentle slumber. If you’re like me, you won’t even notice when that happens. And before you know it, morning arrives. A new day begins, full of promise and possibility. "
"LOS ANGELES, Aug 5 ― US comedian Louis CK, whose previously high-flying career was derailed by sexual misconduct revelations, on Wednesday announced a major international tour beginning next week. CK admitted to masturbating in front of multiple women following a newspaper expose in 2017, just a month after revelations about Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein triggered the global #MeToo movement. After a series of low-key “comeback” gigs in 2018 drew more heated criticism for jokes about school shooting survivors and non-binary people, CK’s attempt to return to major touring last year was postponed by the Covid-19 pandemic. “I’m really looking forward to seeing your faces as I tell some rather impolite jokes and stories,” the former “Louie” star told fans in an email Wednesday. New and rescheduled tour dates on his website include shows in cities across the United States, Germany, Denmark, Romania and Ukraine.  published allegations against CK by five women, who accused him of masturbating or asking to masturbate in front of them or on the telephone, in separate incidents dating from the late 1990s to 2005. The six-time Emmy winner did not deny the allegations, and his mainstream career went up in flames. He was dumped by Netflix, his publicist, the television networks FX and HBO, while a movie project about the relationship between an ageing filmmaker and a teenage girl was scrapped. Last year, CK released a comedy special via his website in which he referred to the scandal, asking the audience “how was 2018 and 2019 for you guys?” “I learned a lot,” he said. “I learned how to eat alone in a restaurant with people giving me the finger from across the room.” ― AFP "
"LOS ANGELES, Aug 5 ― Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, marked her 40th birthday yesterday with a video asking celebrity friends to help women get back to work after the pandemic. The two-minute turn shows the wife of Britain's Prince Harry joking with actress Melissa McCarthy, and comes two months after she gave birth to the couple's second child, Lilibet. “Because I'm turning 40, I'm asking 40 friends to donate 40 minutes of their time to help mentor a woman who is mobilizing back into the workforce,” says the Duchess. Millions of people around the world have lost their jobs in shutdowns sparked by Covid-19, as governments try to tamp down the spread of the disease. “I think if we all do it, and all commit 40 minutes to some sort of act of service, it will create a ripple effect,” she adds. Harry, whose criticism of his family and step away from official royal work has provided fodder for Britain's tabloid press, is seen juggling in the background as Markle and McCarthy joke about tattoos and yacht parties. The couple, who now live in a plush part of California alongside some of the United States's wealthiest celebrities, are forging careers outside the British royal family. Their ventures include the Archewell organisation that released the slick video. Meghan and Harry, 36, sat in March for a bombshell interview with US talk show host Oprah Winfrey, triggering the royal family's biggest crisis in decades. During the two-hour sit-down, viewed by more than 17 million people in the US and over 11 million in Britain, Harry and Meghan said racism had played a part in their departure from Britain. They said a senior royal had speculated how dark their child's skin would be before he was born. Meghan is biracial; her mother is Black and her father is white. Their first child Archie is now two. Lilibet Diana ― named for Harry's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and his late mother ― was born in early June. Markle's video comes weeks after it was announced that Harry will pen an autobiography that he pledged would be a “firsthand account of my life that's accurate and wholly truthful.” ― AFP "

"WASHINGTON: Rafael Nadal crashed out of his comeback event after a two-month layoff, falling to South Africa's 50th-ranked Lloyd Harris on Thursday in a third-round match at the ATP Citi Open. The 35-year-old Spanish left-hander, a 20-time Grand Slam champion, lost to 14th seed Harris 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 in only his second match on the Washington hardcourts. Nadal aggravated a foot injury in a three-set victory over American Jack Sock on Wednesday in his first match since losing a French Open semi-final to Novak Djokovic. But Nadal said after his loss that his left foot was improved even if he could not rally for the victory. ""Best news, the foot was better than yesterday,"" Nadal said. Nadal did not pick up a racquet for 20 days because of his sore foot, skipping Wimbledon and the Olympics. Top seed Nadal played the event for the first time as a chance for more matches to rebuild his fitness as he prepares for the start of the US Open on August 30. ""I'll just keep going accept the challenge before me and I have a chance next week in Toronto,"" Nadal said. Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer all enter the US Open with a men's record 20 career Slam titles, with Djokovic trying to complete the first men's calendar-year Grand Slam since Rod Laver in 1969. Harris was the first player to beat Nadal in their initial meeting since Denis Shapovalov at Montreal in 2017. By ousting third-ranked Nadal, Harris picked up his second win over a top-10 foe this year, the first coming at Dubai over fourth-ranked Dominic Thiem, the reigning US Open champion. Nadal netted a forehand to surrender a break in the seventh game and Harris, ranked a career-best 50th, denied the Spaniard on a break chance in the final game before taking the first set after 39 minutes on a forehand winner. Nadal swatted a spectacular forehand passing winner to break Harris for a 3-1 lead in the second set, a left fist pump and scream showing his delight. He delivered another forehand winner to break for a 5-1 edge and held to force a third set. Harris, 24, saved two break points in the first game of the final set, the second on his 10th ace, and both held until match point, when the South African lifted a winner past Nadal. Nishikori rallied to defeat British seventh seed Cameron Norrie 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. Left-hander Norrie needed right foot treatment after Nishikori broke to lead 3-2. They traded breaks in the final three games, Norrie sending a forehand wide on match point. ""I lost Lloyd in Dubai this year, so not my favourite opponent,"" Nishikori said. ""But we'll see."" In a match of 20-year-olds, Canadian second seed Felix Auger-Aliassime, ranked a career-high 15th, fell to US wildcard Jenson Brooksby 6-3, 6-4. Brooksby, ranked 130th, was runner-up last month at Newport but had never beaten a top-90 opponent. Auger-Aliassime fell behind a set and a break after an hour, double faulting away the fifth game, and Brooksby held at love in the final game, advancing on a service winner after 86 minutes. ""I'll have to see what I could have done in certain areas,"" the Canadian said. ""I fought with what I had, but overall he played a better match."" Brooksby plays for a semi-final berth Friday against Australian 11th seed John Millman. The 32-year-old Aussie, whose only ATP title came last November at Kazakhstan, beat US eighth seed Reilly Opelka 6-3, 7-6 (7/4).

"Despite the divers' best efforts at the Tokyo Olympics, none made the podium for the first time since the 2012 London Games. Malaysia had won a bronze and a silver at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, respectively. If nothing proactive is done soon, Malaysia may just disappear from the world's diving map. The Tokyo diving event proves that other nations have caught up and made inroads since the Rio Olympics.  The Sports Ministry and the National Sports Council (NSC) together with Malaysia Swimming must come up with effective strategies to help the national divers improve in all aspects. More efforts must also be taken to unearth more divers with talent. Credit to Pandelela Rinong, however, as she tried her best to, at least, end Malaysia's diving campaign in Tokyo with a medal yesterday. However, things went wrong for the four-time Olympian when she flopped her opening dive, gaining only 18.00 points from the judges in the women's 10m platform final. Although Pandelela bounced back by recording 71.05 points in her second dive, she could not catch up and fight for medals. She finished last in the 12-field final by posting 245.85 points in the event won by China's 14-year-old sensation Quan Hongchan. It was certainly a disappointing end for Pandelela, who was expected to challenge for the podium after falling short in the platform synchro with Leong Mun Yee last week. Despite the setback in Tokyo, she is still the most successful Malaysian diver at the Olympics, having won bronze (platform) in London and silver (platform synchro with Cheong Jun Hoong) in Rio. Known for her fighting qualities, Pandelela, the World Cup winner in May, is not finished yet.  With the Paris Games only three years from now, the Sarawak-born will continue and prepare for her fifth Olympic outing. ""I didn't expect that to happen during my first dive. When I was doing my run-up to the dive, I slipped, and that affected my momentum,"" Pandelela told Bernama yesterday. ""I tried to control my dive, but there was nothing much I could have done. ""After that, I was just playing catch-up with the other divers, and it just didn't work out for me. ""I accept the decision and the score. I guess I'm just really unlucky this time. It's just not meant to be."" Nonetheless, Pandelela has taken the poor showing in her stride and has vowed to keep going to have another crack at the 2024 Paris Olympics. ""I will definitely compete in the next Olympics. I am not too disheartened as this is not my last Olympics,"" said Pandelela, who will be 31 in 2024. ""I will work harder so that I can push on and qualify for the Paris edition.""

"KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 6 — National shuttler Lee Zii Jia is dreaming of lifting the men’s singles title at the 2021 BWF World Championships in Spain this December. Zii Jia, who returned home recently after crashing out of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said it would be a proud moment for him should he make history by becoming the first Malaysian to win the world title. “Of course, all players aim to win the World Championships because it is one of the biggest tournaments. It’ll be an honour for me if I can become a world champion,” he said at a virtual media conference today. Zii Jia missed the chance to advance to the quarter-finals at the Tokyo Olympics when he lost 21-8, 19-21, 5-21 to eventual silver medallist Chen Long of China in the round of 16 at the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza. Asked what are his plans next, the 23-year-old Zii Jia said he won’t be taking a break and would instead resume training once his quarantine period ends so as to be prepared for the various major tournaments, including the Sudirman Cup in Finland next month and the Thomas Cup in Denmark in October. On his overall performance in the Tokyo Olympics, the world number eight admitted that he was far from satisfied with his display at the world’s biggest multi-sports Games. He said that he had picked up many invaluable lessons and experience in his Olympic debut, especially on how to handle pressure better on the court.  The Kedahan cited 2016 Rio Olympics gold medallist Chen Long as an example, saying the Chinese shuttler used his vast experience to deny Zii Jia a place in the last eight at the Tokyo Olympics when he bounced back from a first-game defeat to easily win the next two games. “Chen Long won because he used his vast experience to overcome the pressure, especially in the second and third games when he seemed so calm. Added to that, he also became more confident and that made me panic there’s definitely a lot for me to improve on after this,” he said. Meanwhile, national men’s singles head coach Hendrawan admitted that he was worried after watching Zii Jia give his everything in the first game against Chen Long as it allowed the Chinese ace to avenge that loss and completely control the next two games. As such, the Indonesian-born coach hopes that Zii Jia would learn from the lesson, adding that he is confident the shuttler would shine in future tournaments.    While advising Zii Jia to continue to battle with his own demons, Hendrawan said the shuttler still needed time to reach the necessary maturity level and that he (the coach) planned to work on further enhancing the shuttler’s technical and fitness levels. — Bernama "

"BARCELONA: Lionel Messi will end his 20-year career with Barcelona after the Argentine superstar failed to reach agreement on a new deal with the club, a decision certain to spark a high-stakes scramble for the signature of a player widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time. ""Although an agreement has been reached between FC Barcelona and Leo Messi it cannot be formalised due to economic and structural obstacles,"" said a statement from the club. ""Faced with this situation, Lionel Messi will not remain linked to Barcelona. Both sides deeply regret that the wishes of both the player and the club cannot come true."" Six-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi, 34, last month finally landed a major international trophy with Argentina when they beat rivals Brazil to win the Copa America. But there had been doubts over his continuation at Barcelona ever since he tried to leave last August as a free agent, citing a clause in his contract and saying the club had  ""no project or anything for a long time.""  Messi, Barca's all-time top scorer and appearance maker, ultimately agreed to see out the final year as the club threatened to go to court. The player, who signed his first contract with Barcelona in 2000 on a napkin when he was just 13, has been a free agent since June 30 when his old agreement expired after Messi had played 788 games for the club. Last season was a comparative disappointment as the club could only land the Spanish Cup and exited in the last 16 of the Champions League, which they last won back in 2015. There had been speculation that Messi would sign on for two years and then potentially head to Major League Soccer, although friend and former Barca teammate Neymar has said he would love to team up with him again at Paris Saint Germain. Barcelona are labouring under debts of several hundred million euros and have been under pressure to reduce their wage bill. The club recently sold left back Junior Firpo to Leeds United and US international Konrad de la Fuente to Marseille. La Liga in 2013 introduced so-called financial ""fair play"" regulations setting a maximum amount of money each club can spend on its playing squad and coaching staff each season, conditioned by their income. At the same time Barcelona has recruited new players which were expected to please Messi, such as Sergio Aguero who joined the Catalan side from Manchester City as a free agent on a two-year deal. Spanish media made much earlier this year of the reported 555 million euros paid Messi over four seasons from November 2017 to the end of last month. National daily El Mundo splashed in January on what it termed ""Messi's pharaonic contract which is ruining Barca"" – that sum including image rights and a series of performance-related bonuses with the player reportedly earning a net 297 million euros. He granted just two interviews over the past year – one in December and the other at the end of the season – and both times he said ""nothing has been decided."" But Joan Laporta had made keeping Messi on the team a priority ever since he was re-elected as Barcelona president in March. ""Leo loves Barca and knows that we are a big family. Hopefully that can help us encourage him to stay,"" he said at the time. The last president Josep Maria Bartomeu was forced to resign in October after the club's members succeeded in achieving a vote of no confidence against him following Messi's attempt to leave.--AFP Fama buys RM375,000 worth of 'durian kampung' to avoid glut Fama buys RM375,000 worth of 'durian kampung' to avoid glut My position will be put to the test this September, says PM Great response to walk in vaccination for senior citizens at Spice CC PPV NSC to meet on Monday to review strategies to combat Covid-19 "
"FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - FC Barcelona v Celta Vigo - Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain - May 16, 2021 Barcelona's Lionel Messi REUTERS/Albert Gea BARCELONA (Reuters) -     FC Barcelona fans were left reeling on Friday after the club announced that star striker Lionel Messi would be leaving the Camp Nou, where he has spent his entire professional career. Messi, now 34, had been expected to sign a new five-year deal, but negotiations fell apart at the last hurdle on Thursday night, with the club blaming financial restrictions imposed by La Liga. ""To suddenly end like this when you thought he was already contracted again... It's really sad, really really sad,"" said 36-year-old student and Barca fan Jose Rivero, standing on the street in the Catalan capital. Messi, who joined Barcelona aged 13, is the club's all-time top scorer, helping them claim 10 league titles, four Champions Leagues and three Club World Cups during a glittering career. Full page photographs of the six-time Ballon d'Or winner were splashed across the front pages of Spain's newspapers, while regional newspaper El Periodico ran with the one-word headline ""Unbelievable."" ""We've been used to having Messi for 20 years and this day was always going to arrive. Now it's here,"" said Tsvetan Georgiev, 36, a carpenter in Barcelona. ""We have to accept it and support him wherever he wants to go."" With debts of more than 1 billion euros, Barcelona would have needed financial restructuring to resign Messi, whose last contract in 2017, was the most lucrative in world sport, according to Spanish newspaper El Mundo. However, they failed to sufficiently reduce their wage bill to stay within La Liga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. The Argentine's next move remains unclear, and for now he is without a club ahead of the 2021-2022 season.  He has long been linked with a move to Manchester City, where he would be reunited with his former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola or France's Paris St Germain, which according to The Athletic, has already made overtures. Still, some observers believe that the announcement of Messi's departure is actually Barca boldly calling La Liga's bluff over its FFP rules.

"BARCELONA, Aug 6 ― Lionel Messi will end his 20-year career with Barcelona after the Argentine superstar and the Spanish giants were unable to overcome “economic and structural obstacles” to a new deal, a bombshell certain to spark a high-stakes scramble for a player widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time. “Although an agreement has been reached between FC Barcelona and Leo Messi it cannot be formalised due to economic and structural obstacles,” said a statement from the club. “Faced with this situation, Lionel Messi will not be staying at Barcelona.

But there had been doubts over his continuation at Barcelona ever since he tried to leave last August as a free agent, citing a clause in his contract and saying the club had had “no project or anything for a long time”. Messi, Barca's all-time top scorer, appearance maker and with who he win 35 trophies, ultimately agreed to see out the final year as the club threatened to go to court. The player, who signed his first contract with Barcelona in 2000 on a napkin when he was just 13, has been a free agent since June 30 when his old agreement expired after Messi had played 788 games for the club. Last season was a comparative disappointment as the club could only land the Spanish Cup and exited in the last 16 of the Champions League, which they last won back in 2015. There had been speculation that Messi would sign on for two years and then potentially head to Major League Soccer, although friend and former Barca teammate Neymar has said he would love to team up with him again at Paris Saint Germain. Barcelona are labouring under debts of several hundred million euros and have been under pressure to reduce their wage bill. The club recently sold left back Junior Firpo to Leeds United and US international Konrad de la Fuente to Marseille. La Liga in 2013 introduced so-called financial “fair play” regulations setting a maximum amount of money each club can spend on its playing squad and coaching staff each season, conditioned by their income. At the same time Barcelona has recruited new players which were expected to please Messi, such as Sergio Aguero who joined the Catalan side from Manchester City as a free agent on a two-year deal. Spanish media made much earlier this year of the reported 555 million euros paid Messi over four seasons from November 2017 to the end of last month. splashed in January on what it termed “Messi's pharaonic contract which is ruining Barca” ― that sum including image rights and a series of performance-related bonuses with the player reportedly earning a net 297 million euros. He granted just two interviews over the past year ― one in December and the other at the end of the season ― and both times he said “nothing has been decided”. But Joan Laporta had made keeping Messi on the team a priority ever since he was re-elected as Barcelona president in March. “Leo loves Barca and knows that we are a big family. Hopefully that can help us encourage him to stay,” he said at the time. The last president Josep Maria Bartomeu was forced to resign in October after the club's members succeeded in achieving a vote of no confidence against him following Messi's attempt to leave. Meanwhile, bookmakers were leaning towards PSG at Messi's next destination. “Punters think the Argentinian wizard's next destination is likely to be 1,000km north in Paris, with PSG the 5/6 favourites to secure his signature,” said Darren Hughes of bookmakers.co.uk. “For those that think the latest twist in this sorry tale may prove to be yet another double-bluff, Messi is 10/3 to start next season in Camp Nou. “Other options include Manchester City at 7/2, or any MLS club at 11/1, while even a return to his homeland with Newell's Old Boys is a staggering 20/1.” ― AFP "

""We have to accept it and support him wherever he wants to go."" With debts of more than 1 billion euros, Barcelona would have needed financial restructuring to resign Messi, whose last contract in 2017, was the most lucrative in world sport, according to Spanish newspaper El Mundo. However, they failed to sufficiently reduce their wage bill to stay within La Liga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. The Argentine's next move remains unclear, and for now he is without a club ahead of the 2021-2022 season.  He has long been linked with a move to Manchester City, where he would be reunited with his former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola or France's Paris St Germain, which according to The Athletic, has already made overtures.

"London's West End has traditionally drawn people from all over the world to see its shows, but theatres have been forced to reinvent themselves after being silenced by the coronavirus pandemic. Photo: AFP  Britain launched a government-backed reinsurance scheme totalling more than US$1bil (RM4.2bil) recently to cover live events against cancellation risk due to the Covid-19 pandemic, after intense industry lobbying. Insurers stripped coronavirus cover from event cancellation policies after the pandemic took hold last year, prompting top entertainment industry figures such as Andrew Lloyd-Webber to demand a government-backed scheme to enable events to go ahead. Festivals, concerts and exhibitions have already suffered cancellations due to the lack of insurance during the pandemic, despite intensive efforts to limit the health risks for performers, events staff and ticket holders. Music festival Womad cancelled its July 2021 event, citing the government’s unwillingness to provide insurance support. The British government is now working with specialist insurance market Lloyd's of London to provide the scheme, the finance ministry said in a statement. And events organisers will from September be able to buy extra insurance against cancellation due to government Covid-19 restrictions, alongside standard events insurance. The insurance will be available from Lloyd's of London syndicates including Beazley, Hiscox and Munich Re, with the government acting as a reinsurer. ""With this new insurance scheme, everything from live music in Margate to business events in Birmingham can go ahead with confidence,"" said British finance minister Rishi Sunak. Tim Thornhill, director of insurance broker Tysers, said the scheme was ""the news that the events industry needed"". It follows a similar £500mil (RM2.9bil) backstop for the film and television industry last year, which has supported 610 independent film and TV productions. However, some industry sources said the new live events scheme was limited, as it covers government lockdowns but does not cover broader social distancing restrictions, or artists' or staff illness due to Covid-19. Paul Reed, CEO of the Association of Independent Festivals, said it was ""imperative"" that the government continued to work with the industry to ""ensure that organisers can plan with increased confidence for 2022"". - Reuters THE pandemic has presented numerous unprecedented challenges in the past year and despite a challenging 2020, AIA Malaysia has made great strides in helping millions of Malaysians get protected, stay protected and most of all get more out of life.

"London's West End has traditionally drawn people from all over the world to see its shows, but theatres have been forced to reinvent themselves after being silenced by the coronavirus pandemic. Photo: AFP  Britain launched a government-backed reinsurance scheme totalling more than US$1bil (RM4.2bil) recently to cover live events against cancellation risk due to the Covid-19 pandemic, after intense industry lobbying. Insurers stripped coronavirus cover from event cancellation policies after the pandemic took hold last year, prompting top entertainment industry figures such as Andrew Lloyd-Webber to demand a government-backed scheme to enable events to go ahead. Festivals, concerts and exhibitions have already suffered cancellations due to the lack of insurance during the pandemic, despite intensive efforts to limit the health risks for performers, events staff and ticket holders. Music festival Womad cancelled its July 2021 event, citing the government’s unwillingness to provide insurance support. The British government is now working with specialist insurance market Lloyd's of London to provide the scheme, the finance ministry said in a statement. And events organisers will from September be able to buy extra insurance against cancellation due to government Covid-19 restrictions, alongside standard events insurance. The insurance will be available from Lloyd's of London syndicates including Beazley, Hiscox and Munich Re, with the government acting as a reinsurer. ""With this new insurance scheme, everything from live music in Margate to business events in Birmingham can go ahead with confidence,"" said British finance minister Rishi Sunak. Tim Thornhill, director of insurance broker Tysers, said the scheme was ""the news that the events industry needed"". It follows a similar £500mil (RM2.9bil) backstop for the film and television industry last year, which has supported 610 independent film and TV productions. However, some industry sources said the new live events scheme was limited, as it covers government lockdowns but does not cover broader social distancing restrictions, or artists' or staff illness due to Covid-19. Paul Reed, CEO of the Association of Independent Festivals, said it was ""imperative"" that the government continued to work with the industry to ""ensure that organisers can plan with increased confidence for 2022"". - Reuters WHAT comes to mind when you think of Hong Kong?

"PETALING JAYA: The Dewan Rakyat Speaker should give assurance that the Parliament sitting will go on as planned on Monday (Aug 2), says Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. The Opposition leader, along with other Opposition lawmakers, said the - Speaker Datuk Azhar Azizan Harun and the Deputy Speaker Datuk Mohd Rashid Hasnon - were not clear as to when the Parliament sitting was adjourned to. “There is supposed to be a sitting scheduled on Monday, but we are a little suspicious as the Deputy Speaker said the Parliament had adjourned without mentioning the word ‘Monday’. “We have voiced our protests to the Speaker, and he said ‘yes we can, but we must wait for the decision by the Health director-general’. “This is all a shadow play and a charade, and this must stop,” he said in a press conference on Thursday (July 29). He pressed for a firm commitment from the Speaker that the special Parliament sitting will indeed continue on Monday. Earlier, Mohd Rashid said that Parliament had adjourned, to much outrage and jeers by Opposition MPs. Anwar said that the Opposition MPs met with the Speaker after the announcement and they protested the decision to delay the sitting. “He should give us room to raise our motion, but he adjourned the sitting. “We have told him that he has read the Istana Negara statement - he has firstly disobeyed the King, secondly, violated the Federal Constitution and insulted Parliament. “He is no longer worthy to continue in his responsibility as Speaker under such conditions,” he claimed. Anwar said the Speaker also acknowledged the receipt of the motion he submitted to call for Muhyiddin’s resignation as prime minister. He further said the government should not be afraid to test its majority in Parliament, in reply to Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s statement that the government still enjoys a majority. Earlier, Ismail Sabri maintained that the government still enjoys the support of more than 110 MPs who are still with the government of the day.

"KUALA LUMPUR: Having 90 per cent of the country's adult population fully inoculated before lifting the ban on interstate travel will create a safer environment for all. Malaysian Medical Association former president Datuk Dr N.K.S. Tharmaseelan said while securing 90 per cent vaccination rate was an achievement itself, the move to allow interstate travel was timely as well.  ""Being confined at home for such long periods would have long-term effects on the mental well-being  of an individual.   ""By having 90 per cent of the adult population vaccinated is a figure that would probably create a much safer environment to travel and (businesses to) open up.  ""Therefore, it is certainly reasonable and well-founded to allow interstate travel,"" he said when contacted.   Dr Tharmasselan was commenting on the government's announcement that the ban on interstate travel is expected to be lifted after 90 per cent of the country's adult population have been fully inoculated.  He added that Malaysians must continue following the standard operating procedures strictly after the reopening.   ""It has to become a part of our daily routine even if they have received both of their vaccination doses.""  On Wednesday, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob in a statement said interstate travel and the reopening of other tourist destinations, irrespective of those located on islands or mainland, will be allowed after 90 per cent of the country's adult population have been fully inoculated.  Ismail Sabri, however, said the easing of such restrictions was also subjected to data and analysis conducted by the Health Ministry.
